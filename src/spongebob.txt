SpongeBob: [Stands in Jellyfish Fields. A blue jellyfish floats by SpongeBob. SpongeBob comes from behind a bush and stares at the jellyfish through a telescope. Cuts to his view with the telescope] Wow, four stingers. [Puts away the telescope and puts on his glasses. Cuts to the jellyfish, where SpongeBob floats over it with his net. Cuts to the jellyfish alone, where SpongeBob's foot stretches out from off-screen and then the rest of his body appears. He attempts to grab the jellyfish in his net, but he catches himself in the net, then the jellyfish flies away. In the background, a young girl's voice is heard struggling. SpongeBob looks down a cliff and sees the land creature trying to fight a giant clam attempting. SpongeBob gasps] Where have I seen this before? [takes out his Field Guide book and skims through the pages] Here it is. [cut to picture of a squirrel] Land squirrel. [He closes the book] That little squirrel is in trouble. [cuts to the squirrel, who is pushing the clam into the ground]
Sandy: Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners! [she walks away] You're about as ugly as homemade soup. 
SpongeBob: Hooray, land squirrel! [cuts back to the land squirrel, who is oblivious to the clam resurfacing and jumping right at her. Cuts to SpongeBob, who is shocked, his glasses shoot up] Look out! [scene cuts to the clam with Sandy trying to escape the clam] Hold on, little squirrel! [He does a karate yell in front of the clam, then does the same while bouncing to different sides. He jumps high in the air, and lands on top of the clam; he poses on top of the giant clam] You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai! [tries to pry open the clam; he stops] Hey, I'm actually doing it. [SpongeBob continues, Sandy finishes prying the clam open from inside it and SpongeBob goes flying into a sea plant] Your shell is mine! 
[SpongeBob pulls up his pants and starts to charge at the clam. He jumps into the clam's mouth and starts to strangle its tongue. SpongeBob sees that Sandy has already escaped and the clam swallows him now.] 
Sandy: Hold on there, little square dude! [She then gets SpongeBob out and kicks the clam around some more and finally kicks it across the sea. The clam whimpers. Sandy leans down to see if SpongeBob is okay.] 
SpongeBob: Hey, you like karate too. [SpongeBob does some karate poses, then he stops and falls flat on his head] So, uhh, what's your name? 
Sandy: Sandy. [makes athletic moves] So what do y'all call yourself? 
SpongeBob: [runs up a big rock] I'm SpongeBob! [jumps down, SpongeBob soon lands on one of his corners] 
Sandy: Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this. [she walks next to a huge rock and slaps it with her hand, making a gong sound effect which precedes the rock breaking into pieces] 
SpongeBob: Oh. [Sandy grins and blinks] Oh yeah? Watch this [He prepares to do a karate move, but all he does is make an armpit fart noise. Sandy walks on-screen giggling] 
Sandy: I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah![Karate chops SpongeBob’s head.] 
SpongeBob: Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah! [Karate chops her helmet, but realizes it hurts.] Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head? 
Sandy: Why, that's my air helmet. 
SpongeBob: May I try it on? 
Sandy: Heck no. I need it to breathe. I gotta have my air. 
SpongeBob: Me too. I love air. Air is good. 
Sandy: No kidding? 
SpongeBob: Why, "air" is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air. 
Sandy: Shee-oot. How about comin' over tomorrow for tea and cookies then? [shows a map leading to Sandy's house] Don't be late. 
SpongeBob: Okay, see you tomorrow. [runs to Patrick's house. Patrick is sun tanning on his rock] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air? 
Patrick: Huh? 
SpongeBob: I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air. 
Patrick: Do you mean she puts on "airs"? 
SpongeBob: I guess so. 
Patrick: That's just fancy talk. If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are. 
SpongeBob: [holds his pinky up] How's that? 
Patrick: Higher. 
SpongeBob: Like that? 
Patrick: Now that's fancy. They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants. [cuts to Sandy's treedome] Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching. [Opens the door as SpongeBob walks in with his pinky raised high and flowers in his right hand.] 
SpongeBob: Thanks, pal. [rings the doorbell with a bouquet in his hand] 
Sandy: Hello? 
SpongeBob: Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob. 
Sandy: Hold on a sec, I'll let you in. 
SpongeBob: [whistles then all the water goes down the drain. SpongeBob bangs on the door] Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy! [Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob jiggles on the ground] Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in... [looks around] ...here. 
Sandy: ‘Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air. 
SpongeBob: [waves his hand around and smells the air] No water? 
Sandy: That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah! 
SpongeBob: Problem? [laughing] Hi-yah! That's how I like my air! [takes a deep breath as Sandy walks off. As soon as she leaves, he lets it all out, and gets black circles around his eyes] With no water. 
Sandy: [cartwheeling] Well, alright. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah! [SpongeBob is walking an inch forward and it makes weak squeaking sounds with every step] That's not in. In. [SpongeBob walks another inch and there is more squeaking. Sandy runs, gets SpongeBob, takes his hand, and runs off] You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour. [fades to the blazing sun and pan down where Sandy and SpongeBob are standing] So this is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest... [SpongeBob gasps] ...purest... [SpongeBob gasps again] ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath. [Cuts to the birdbath, where a red robin is splashing and chirping] And that's my oak tree. [SpongeBob seems enticed by the water in the birdbath. He tries to sneak away, but stays until Sandy lets her guard down] It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees? [SpongeBob nods] Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I... [SpongeBob finally escapes and wallows in the birdbath, absorbing all the water. He then jumps back to his original spot, and the bird is quite angry. SpongeBob gets back before Sandy notices] ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Let’s have that tea now. [Does in-air karate moves and moves off-screen. SpongeBob gasps. He hears some knocking from outside. It's Patrick, pointing at his pinky] 
Patrick: Pinky. Pinky. 
SpongeBob: [blinks, weakly holds up his pinky, and gasps again. Fade to him sitting at a picnic bench. He now has little wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth is all puckered up. He holds up his bouquet] I brought you some flowers. 
Sandy: [walks over] For me? How sweet. [Sandy grabs the flowers, but SpongeBob refuses to let go. She finally pries them loose and part of SpongeBob's pinky falls off. He closes his hand] You okay? 
SpongeBob: [the black circles around his eyes are gone. His voice is now hoarse] Yes, I'm okay. 
Sandy: You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit. 
SpongeBob: I can’t imagine why. 
Sandy: Can I get you anything? 
SpongeBob: Water would be nice. 
Sandy: I'm gonna to put these in a vase. 
SpongeBob: Take your time. [Sandy goes in her tree and closes the door off-screen. SpongeBob hears it, he then gasps and stumbles toward the door and struggles to open it] I gotta get out of here! Aaaahh! [he then thinks] 
Sandy: [in SpongeBob's head] I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree. 
[SpongeBob struggles even more] 
Patrick: [in SpongeBob's head] When in doubt, pinky out. 
SpongeBob: [lifts his pinky up. He then gets confidence and victorious music plays.] I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... [he then sits down, loses confidence again and the music stops] 
Sandy: Why, these flowers are just beautiful! [sniffs] They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice cold water. [puts the vase down. SpongeBob is totally enticed by the water. Sandy sits down across from him] So tell me about yourself. [Sandy puts her hands under head feeling fascinated about SpongeBob sharing himself] It must be fascinatin' bein' a sea critter. [SpongeBob watches a drop of water drop down the side of the glass] SpongeBob? [a timer goes off] Oh, there's the cookies. [walks back into the tree] Be right back. 
SpongeBob: [thinking] I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face. He's really shriveled now] I don't need it. [close-up of vase, then another one of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [close-up of vase] I don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [long pause, finally yelling ] I need it! [He shoots up into the air, bounces off the ceiling and holds the vase.] 
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky! 
SpongeBob: [holds up his pinky and starts guzzling down the whole vase of water] I'm a quitter! [screams and runs around] 
Patrick: [enters into the dome and slams the door shut] You can't leave now. You'll blow it. 
SpongeBob: [hanging on the door] Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good. 
Patrick: [grabs SpongeBob off the door] You're just being shy. [carries SpongeBob to the picnic table] Don't worry, buddy. You're doi'’ fine. [starts getting weak] I won't let you blow... this. [drops SpongeBob and crawls on the floor, panting. He coughs and sputters, then stands up] What kind of place is this?! [runs toward the door and tries to open it] There's no water in here! 
SpongeBob: [joins in on the door-opening struggle] I tried to tell you! 
Patrick: We've gotta get out of here! 
SpongeBob: You're... doing it... wrong... 
Patrick: Wait, no! We've got... to get... out. [The two pass out.] 
[fades to the sun] 
Sandy: [walks out of the tree with tea and cookies] Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this... 
[She screams and drops her tray. On the grass is a live-action sponge and starfish. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick leaning against a ladder with two goldfish helmets on. Sandy, on top of the ladder, uses a hose to fill those helmets with water] 
Sandy: There, that oughta do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked. [Sandy carries over a tray with three tea glasses. Everyone takes one] I propose a toast, to new friends. [She drinks it. SpongeBob and Patrick lift their drinks up and they clink the glasses on the helmets, causing them to spill] Hold on a second. [She places a tea bag in each helmet, allowing the two to drink the tea water] I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up. [Patrick nudges SpongeBob and they both put their pinkies up. They sip the tea.] 
All: Ahhh... 
[Screen cuts to black.]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob walks outside his house, and breathes in the fresh air] Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful. [SpongeBob immediately grabs wood, a hammer, and some nails, and starts to noisily build a stand. Squidward peeks his head out the window]
Squidward: Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
Squidward: Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm.
SpongeBob: Okay. [he taps on a nail lightly, and he looks up at Squidward's window. He does it again, and continues to, making sure he doesn't make too much noise. Meanwhile, in Squidward's house, Squidward has his clarinet in hand]
Squidward: And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you. [He starts to play. SpongeBob looks up and sees that Squidward is playing, so he decides to finish his stand quickly. Squidward looks out the window again.]
Squidward: I thought I... Wha?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
Squidward: Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Uh huh.
Squidward: Oh, puh-lease. I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles? [Patrick comes out of his house, stuck to the underside of the rock]
Patrick: Good morning. [he falls and screams]
Squidward: Oh, boy. [Patrick walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
Patrick: Hmm, how much is it?
SpongeBob: Only a quarter.
Patrick: Sounds reasonable. [whispering] Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Patrick. [he pulls out a quarter and he gives it to Patrick]
Patrick: Ah, one quarter. [he hands the quarter back to SpongeBob, and bites it to see if it's real]
SpongeBob: Thank you. [cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Hmm, business is booming. [he laughs] How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh huh. [he continues playing. Cut back to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob dips the wand in the bubble soap]
SpongeBob: One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go. [Patrick grabs the wand from SpongeBob, inhales deeply and begins to blow, but a bubble doesn't come out. He pants and blows again. After a while, SpongeBob puts up a "Lessons" sign. Patrick then loses his breath] Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
Patrick: Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter? [SpongeBob hands Patrick a quarter] Thanks. [he winks and hands the quarter back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique. [he starts doing his infamous routine] First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... [he blows bubbles shaped like ducks]
Patrick: Oooh. [SpongeBob pops out of nowhere and blows a box. Patrick giggles and SpongeBob blows a caterpillar] Ah! [The caterpillar then pops one-by-one, with descending sounds. Patrick continues to giggle. SpongeBob blows a tugboat, and it floats off, pops, and makes a foghorn noise. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house]
Squidward: Huh? [he shakes his clarinet. Cut back to outside with SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: And now... with two hands! [he inhales deeply and blows out an elephant. Circus music, in particular part of the piece "Entry of the Gladiators", starts playing.]
Patrick: [Laughs] It's a giraffe! [Patrick continues laughing as the elephant floats over into Squidward's house. SpongeBob then worried as the bubble pops and tons of smaller bubbles come out of both windows of the house while an elephant sounds. Squidward opens the door with a sour look on his face. SpongeBob and Patrick hide behind the stand. SpongeBob places a "Closed" sign on it. Squidward looks over the stand]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-
Squidward: Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!
SpongeBob: We're not just blowing bubbles. We're making bubble art. Watch carefully. [he does his infamous routine again] First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... [he blows a butterfly, which flies over to Squidward, lands on his head, and pops]
Squidward: That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard. [SpongeBob and Patrick, now depressed, head to SpongeBob's house] You should be ashamed of yourselves. [SpongeBob closes the door as Squidward laughs to himself] Bubbles. [he continues laughing] Art. [he mumbles, and picks up the bubble wand, sniffs it, and inhales to blow. Then, SpongeBob pops up out of nowhere]
SpongeBob: That'll be 25 cents, sir.
Squidward: Ah, whoa, what? [SpongeBob blinks] Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
SpongeBob: We also offer lessons for beginners. [he puts the "Lessons" sign up]
Squidward: Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble? [he pulls a quarter out] Here's your 25 cents! [SpongeBob bites it to see if it's real and it bends] Watch and learn. [he inhales and blows, but nothing happens] Uhh... wait, wait, wait. [he inhales and blows again, but nothing happens again] One more time. Here. Wait. [he inhales and blows again, and a small bubble comes out and instantly falls to the ground and bursts, making a fart sound. Looks over at SpongeBob and Patrick. They gulp, and then start whistling. Squidward places another quarter on the stand] Uhh... Just a mere warm-up. [he dips the wand in the bubble container, inhales deeply and blows hard. The bubble falls to the ground again, making another fart sound, gets another quarter out and puts it on the stand]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, remember the technique. [Squidward keeps trying to blow bubbles while SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to show him the technique] Squidward, technique! You do this, and this, step back....
Patrick: Hey! Technique, Squidward!
SpongeBob: Spin around like thi— Like this...  Look at me, over here, one... two.... yeah, three...
Patrick: The pelvic woo!
SpongeBob: Look, we're doing the technique! And don't for... Don't forget the "Woooooo!" Squidward?
Patrick: Listen to Sponge!
SpongeBob: Technique! Technique! Technique!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [while standing on one foot] Technique! Technique! Technique! Technique! Tech- [Squidward looks at them]
SpongeBob: [weakly] You're not doing the technique.
Patrick: Technique.
Squidward: Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique! [he starts to do the infamous routine, while imitating SpongeBob] First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then... [Screams into the wand, blowing a gargantuan, unshaped bubble]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [Squidward is then lifted off the ground. The bubble pops off the wand and Squidward falls back on the ground]
SpongeBob: All right, Squid. That was so good.
Patrick: Squid is number one.
Squidward: I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that.
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: Now that's a bubble.
SpongeBob: You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique.
Patrick: Yeah, technique.
Squidward: Technique? Hah. SpongeBob, you don't think I created that [kisses his tentacle] beautiful work of art with your help? [he starts laughing] Come on, it's in my genes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squid's got genes! Squid's got genes! [Squidward walks back to his house]
Squidward: Thank you, thank you, thank you. [he starts to play his clarinet. SpongeBob and Patrick chant Squidward's name. At one point, they belly flop each other and Patrick falls on the ground.] I rock. [Squidward continues to play his clarinet. As SpongeBob and Patrick continue to chant, Squidward's bubble flies over them, covers Squidward's house, and pulls it out of the ground and up towards the top of the ocean. SpongeBob notices and stops Patrick]
SpongeBob: [concerned] Squidward! [Patrick now notices]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! [Squidward stops playing his clarinet]
Squidward: Hello, my friends. You are looking at a... [he sees how high he is from the sky]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
Squidward: ...genius. [the bubble explodes in the air and then the ground violently rumbles and shakes. SpongeBob and Patrick look in awe]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [the ground stops shaking. The two slowly walk back to their homes. They then speed up and run inside their houses. Squidward's house floats back to the surface. He starts playing his clarinet weakly as the screen cuts to black, ending the episode]
Squidward: Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. [blows kiss] Congratulations, chef! [gets dressed, takes a shower, gargles, and brushes his teeth. He re-enters the scene in a tuxedo and sits down at the table. He hears laughter from outside. He goes to the window and notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick.
[Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops]
Patrick Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, blows a bubble of his own from the liquid of his soufflé with a fork. SpongeBob whispers into another bubble]
SpongeBob: [whispering into bubble] Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
[the bubble floats over but is kicked when Squidward's bubble approaches, popping SpongeBob's bubble. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
[Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [whispering into the bubble] Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. [the bubble floats over to Patrick and pops, followed by another bubble floating back over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly. [another bubble comes over and pops] Yellow is ugly! [two other bubbles, but smaller, float over and pops, both containing raspberry noises for SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [talks into the bubble, puzzled] Patrick, what are you talking about?
[The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. [SpongeBob gasps] You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
[Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
[Squidward laughs. Another bubble floats over to Patrick]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
Patrick: [stands up and yells at SpongeBob] Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob: [stands up and yells at Patrick] Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
Patrick: Right, you're a turkey!
SpongeBob: What's that? [Squidward arrives outside with a lawn chair and his soufflé]
Patrick: It's what you are!
[Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.]
SpongeBob: Well, you're a bigger one!
Patrick: Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You are!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! [he goes inside through the back door and turns around] Aww, tartar sauce! [shuts door]
[Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. ]
Squidward: [Laughs at Patrick. Puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth.] [Continues laughing. Moves his tentacles around in laughter, then lies back in laughter accidentally swallowing the fork and choking on it. Chokes on the fork repeatedly and his skin turns to a deep shade of blue as the letters "K" and "O" appear in his right eye and left eye respectively and flashes appears. Squidward passes out and drools]
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you're choking! [runs over to Squidward] Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. [he takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it] I win!
Squidward: Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick: I did?
Squidward: Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! [shakes Patrick's hands]
Patrick: Friend? [holds Squidward] Friend...
Squidward: [uneasily] Yeah, Patrick, we're friends... [steps back] just friends. [they both notice SpongeBob is gazing from his window with a blank stare]
Patrick: So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? [walks with Squidward over to the Easter Island head]
Squidward: Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick: Clarinet? I love music!
[inside the pineapple, SpongeBob watches the two go inside Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? [Gary is sleeping inside his shell] Gary? [knocks on his shell]
[cut to Squidward's]
Squidward: Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick: [sitting on a bench while clapping] Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! [Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note, and Patrick immediately falls asleep, to the annoyance of Squidward. Scene cuts to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! [he holds up three fingers] Uhh... [he draws faces on each finger with a broken smile] The gang's all here... [he looks at the faces on his fingers, and his eyes well with tears] Ohhh!
[Squidward is dragging Patrick, who is still asleep, outside. Suddenly, after a few feet, his back gives out]
Squidward: Ow! Oh! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob: [sees Squidward in pain] Oh, boy, now's my chance! [jumps out of the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob: [running] Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
Squidward: No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob: Hang on! I'll save you! [rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath]
Squidward: [tries to get to his door] No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
SpongeBob: [jumps off a diving board] Hold on!
Squidward: No, no! Get away! [screams as SpongeBob dives into his back cracking it back into place] Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend! [SpongeBob smiles big]
SpongeBob: Friend...
Squidward: N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. [Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter Island head] So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
Squidward: You play?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! [he takes one from the wall] Give me an A, buddy! [Squidward plays a note and SpongeBob sings] Squidward is my best friend in the world. [grates strings with bow] Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
[The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee]
SpongeBob: [now playing with his fingers like a guitar] Squidward...
Patrick: [pops in through the window] Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob. [SpongeBob slams the window in Patrick's face] Oh!
SpongeBob: [strums harder before slamming the bass to the floor] And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! [smashes the bass] Umm, I can fix this. [Squidward is steaming red in fury]
Squidward: Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! [he kicks SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward: Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. [opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. [shows him a brush and soap]
Squidward: Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! [SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? [notices Patrick in the bath-tub] Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... [shown bath toys] ...rubber bath toys!
Patrick: [simultaneously] Oh, yeah?! Well, he was my friend first!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously] You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
Squidward: [screams] This can't be happening to me! [He runs away. SpongeBob and Patrick stop their arguing as they notice Squidward's gone]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
SpongeBob: Buddy!
Patrick: Squidward, where are you?!
SpongeBob: Where'd ya go, friend?
Patrick: Where are ya, ol' buddy?
Squidward: [hiding in a trash can] Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and outta my hair!
SpongeBob: [reading a magazine as the doorbell rings a letter is pushed under the door. Then he smells it] Squidward. [opens it] A dinner party? I'd love to! [SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward opens it] Did you miss me?
Squidward: Come on in! You look stunning. [shuts door]
SpongeBob: I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... [gasps when he sees Patrick] Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!
Patrick: Me neither! This was a setup!
Squidward: I thought you two were my best friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: I am your best friend!
Squidward: [takes out a bottle of soda] Well, how about some soda, guys? [SpongeBob shows him his glass]
SpongeBob: Yes, please! [Squidward gives him some soda] Thanks, friend. [flicks Squidward's nose] [drinks]
Patrick: How about some for your best friend? [SpongeBob puts his glass in front of Patrick's, so he gets the soda instead of Patrick]
SpongeBob: Thanks, best friend! [drinks]
Patrick: Can I have some now, buddy?
SpongeBob: Wait, I need some more! [pours SpongeBob another glass]
Patrick: I still didn't get any! [SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda]
SpongeBob: There ya go. More please! [Squidward fills his glass as SpongeBob drinks it really fast]
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward! [shows Squidward his glass again, but it's still full] Squidward!
Squidward: Patrick! Your glass is full!
Patrick: Oh, yeah...
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both show Squidward their glasses] Squidward!
Squidward: Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. [walks away] Why don't you just stay here and chat? [closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard] I should just walk away right now. [opens door to find his house destroyed] What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? [pieces around the door break]
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? [both hug]
Patrick: Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Squidward: Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
Squidward: No! Out! [both walk out]
SpongeBob: Psst, I think he's jealous.
Patrick: How pathetic. [Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back]
Squidward: Ohhhhh, my back.
Squidward: [The scene starts at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cleaning a table] Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home!
[phone rings]
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it! Coming. [leaps for the phone but Squidward answers it first. SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims]
Squidward: Hello? Sorry, sir, we're close... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? [eyes turn into dollar signs] Um... Of course we have pizza.
Squidward: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby patties and turns it into pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver.
Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver, [gives Squidward the pizza] but you do.
Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. [SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big]
Squidward: That's not what I had in mind!
SpongeBob: Front end... check. Antenna... [touches the boat antenna making it vibrate] check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker... [bumper sticker says "I Brake For Sea Urchins"] ...check. [uncaps the tire pressure and puts his mouth in it, causing him to inflate like a balloon, and talk in a squeaky, high pitched voice while he is now the size of a giant parade balloon] Tire pressure! [blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face, returning him to his normal size and voice] ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!
Squidward: Good, then you drive.
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but...
Squidward: Just do what you do in school.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Squidward: Back... it up.
SpongeBob: Right, back... it up. [tries to move the stick shift down]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay!
Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse. [SpongeBob imagines the words "FORWARD" and "BACKWARD" turning into Korean characters, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (BACKWARD)]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: [shifts gears] Backing up! Backing up! [boat backs up really fast]
Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel!
SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [they go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The next morning, the boat goes over five hills] Backing up. Backing up. Backing up. [boat stops with no fuel left] Backing up.
Squidward: Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Squidward: And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?! [kicks boat and the boat's gasoline becomes full again and it drives away into the distance without them]
SpongeBob: Well, we can still deliver it on foot. [Squidward narrows his eyes. Later, both walk on the sand]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: [singing] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
Squidward: ...And my feet are killing me. Whoa. [trips over SpongeBob, who is lying on the ground] SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: [rubbing the ground] It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for...
SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: [pointing to the road] Truck! Sixteen wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked. [starts dancing in the road while wearing a hat] Whee... eee... [Squidward sits on a rock while playing with a wooden spoon]
Truck Driver: Crashin' frashin' break dancers! [honks his truck]
Squidward: He's stopping! He's stopping! [Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck. Squidward narrows his eyes at the smiling SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Squidward are now in a place with heavy winds] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza [The wind blows on Squidward's nose making it touch his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth.] is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds]
Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
SpongeBob: [still being carried around in the air] I can't, it's for the customer!
Squidward: Well, who cares about the customer?!
SpongeBob: I do!
Squidward: Well, I don't!
SpongeBob: [wind stops and SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [starts flying again]
Squidward: Let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! [runs over Squidward]
Squidward: Ow. [holding SpongeBob's legs] SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! It's for the customer!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza! [lifts up into the tornado]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [looks down] Hang onto the pizza! [tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Where's the road? [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!
SpongeBob: I think town's this way. [points]
Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
SpongeBob: That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization.
Squidward: That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
SpongeBob: [nods again] Yep.
Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way]
SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction]
SpongeBob: [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Still later] Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me! [later] Krab Pizza... for you. Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside. [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand]
Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something.
SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] No, maybe it wasn't coral. [Squidward spits out the coral] Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud.
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
Squidward: Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No, we promised it's for the customer.
Squidward: [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
SpongeBob: Well?
Squidward: Just a peek. [opens box]
SpongeBob: [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine.
Squidward: No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: And the pepperoni?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: [SpongeBob slurps] Oh, looks good, huh?
SpongeBob: Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do, Squidward. [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Get away!
Squidward: [chases SpongeBob] Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Wait! [he becomes too tired to run]
SpongeBob: No! No! [runs into Squidward]
Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
SpongeBob: Look, we're saved!
Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
SpongeBob: No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants]
Squidward: Will you cut that out?!
SpongeBob: [to a conga beat] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again. SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder. [sniff] It's a rock. [cries] A rock! A rock! Its a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!
SpongeBob: [they stop outside the customer's house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer’s face! [rings doorbell]
Tom: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
Tom: Wow, thanks! I've been dying for one of these. It... [brief pause] Where's my drink?
SpongeBob: [confused] What drink?
Tom: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
SpongeBob: [checks through the order] But, you didn't order any...
Tom: [yelling] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!
SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face]
Tom: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy?! Well, I ain't buying! [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry]
Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [Squidward gets angry, grabs the pizza, stomps towards the customer's house and pounds on the door]
Tom: [answers the door, still angry] Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't paying for that!
Squidward: [Tom's point of view] Well, this one's on the House! [slams the pizza box in Tom's face]
SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind?
Squidward: [smugly] He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.
SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink?
Squidward: Nah. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock]
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work. [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Work? [screen cuts to black] Oh, my aching tentacles!
Nematodes: Walking, walking, walking, walking. [continue to repeat "walking"]
Nematode #1: Hungry!
Nematodes: Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. [continue to repeat "hungry." All eat a whole large piece of coral]
Nematode #1: Still hungry!
Nematodes: Still hungry, still hungry, still hungry, still hungry. [continue to repeat "still hungry." All eat a truck that drives by, leaving the driver floating]
Fred: Naw, dang nematodes!
Nematode #1: Thirsty!
Nematodes: Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. [continue to repeat "thirsty." They all bounce to SpongeBob's house and take out some straws. Then start drinking up the pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are still sleeping as everything begins to shrink inside, even Gary's food bowl]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed begins to shrink as he wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no! [squeezes through the door as he tries to get to the phone. Gary gets stuck in the door]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Shellphone! I know, I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do!
Squidward: [on the other line] Hello?
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
SpongeBob: [as he talks to Squidward, his voice gets higher and higher and starts talking faster until the shellphone completely disappears] Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller... [high-pitched squeaky talking. Then the phone call is disconnected] Oh no!
Squidward: Yep, it is. [SpongeBob screams]
Patrick: [comes out from his rock] Is it time already to ruin Squid's day? [falls off rock onto his furniture, then jumps out with a tuxedo and tophat on] Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!
Nematodes: [continue sucking on SpongeBob's house, then they all burp and leave]
SpongeBob: Ohh... nematodes. [sees a seed on the ground, then picks it up] The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. [Patrick and Squidward walk up]
Squidward: What's going on here?
SpongeBob: I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
Squidward: [smiling] Yeah...
Patrick: [his eyes bulge excessively in surprise] Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Squidward: Well, what can I say? [begins to shake SpongeBob's hand] It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else. [walks back to his house] [sarcastically talks] I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. [party favors fly out Squidward's windows as he parties] Boo-hoo! [starts to laugh]
Patrick: Squid's taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?
SpongeBob: I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. [shown a picture of SpongeBob's parents smiling]
Patrick: No, wait a minute, no you don't. [shown picture of SpongeBob's parents frowning] We can build you a new house!
SpongeBob: We can't build a house!
Patrick: Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! [antenna on Patrick's rock falls off]
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! [zoom in on SpongeBob and Patrick as construction workers] 
Patrick: [Patrick tries to hit a nail into a board, but hits his hand instead] Ow! Ow! Ow! [SpongeBob takes two buckets of paint, one red and one green. He pours the red paint on his backside and pours the green paint on his front side. He puts one side on a fence so that the paint gets on it, and then he does the other side the same way. He does this twice. As he tightens a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick sliding, falling upside down towards the sky, then back onto the ground right side up. SpongeBob nails pieces of wooden boards together in midair, and a piece falls off and lands on Patrick's hand, leading him to say "Ow!" each time. Patrick moves his board under the next board, which falls down on his hand. This happens several times. Next, shown SpongeBob's finished house, shown also with sparkles]
Patrick: [Patrick gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb] We're done!
SpongeBob: Yeah! So what do you think?
Patrick: [SpongeBob's built house sparkles a bit] I wish I lived there.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob puts the small pineapple on his head]
SpongeBob: One bedroom. [nose sticks out through the door and the pineapple breaks into pieces]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob: [pets Gary] Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
Patrick: Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
SpongeBob: That'd be great!
Patrick: Yeah! We'll be rockmates! [SpongeBob and Patrick get ready to sleep under Patrick's rock] Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, rockmate.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [SpongeBob goes to sleep but then is awaken to Patrick's snoring] Oh...what the...? [Gary hides in his shell and SpongeBob puts a cork in the sides of his head, and goes back to sleep. The wind blows and Patrick shivers, he then pulls the rock closer to him, SpongeBob shivers in the cold and pulls it back over himself. Gary sits on top of the rock as they keep pulling it back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold and he covers himself with sand on and goes to sleep. Patrick starts drooling heavily, filling his mouth, and flows like a stream over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat sponge. He waddles over to Patrick and removes the corks, spilling Patrick's drool out of him and down-sizing him to normal size. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick struggles, then spits out the cork]
Patrick: [in his sleep] A spider! Spiders! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! [lifts rock and starts smashing SpongeBob with it several times, he then goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick! Wake up! Wake up! It's me, SpongeBob! [moves away from the rock a few feet and goes back to sleep]
Patrick: Spiders! Spiders! [picks up his rock, runs over to SpongeBob, and smashes him repeatedly with the rock]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [Patrick goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: [in Squidward's house, he stands next to Squidward, holding Gary, as Squidward sleeps, he taps Squidward's nose as he whispers] Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] H-h-huh?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] Whoa. Huh? Wha-what?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
SpongeBob: Thanks. Thanks, Squidward. [gets in bed with Squidward] Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, oh, yeah, sure. [scoots over to the side]
SpongeBob: While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
Squidward: [sleepily] Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure. [Sleepily talks a bit, gets out of bed and walks off, then comes back with a glass of water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. [Squidward hands SpongeBob the glass] Thanks, buddy.
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome. [SpongeBob drinks the water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I like sleepovers.
Squidward: [sleepily] Yeah. Me, too.
SpongeBob: Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: [yawns] Good night, SpongeBob. [Squidward's eyes pop open. Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Gary walk out] [unhappy] Good night, SpongeBob. [night turns to day then rooster crows everyone up. Squidward opens his eyes excitedly] Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late! [he flies into his closet, gets dressed, and goes outside] Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand outside, with bags] I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
Squidward: Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob. [changes his smile to a frown briefly] Please.
SpongeBob: Here come my parents. [Patrick beings to cry and the car horn sounds as SpongeBob's parents drive up]
Mrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here!
Mr. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mom.
Squidward: Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. [picks up the bags and carries them to the car]
SpongeBob: Just give me a minute. [walks back to where his house used to be] I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. [buries it into the ground in the middle of where his house used to be] You hold too many memories. [as he starts to cry, a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it, it then starts to glow. Then SpongeBob shakes Squidward's hand] Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. [walks away]
Squidward: Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye. [dances] Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. [Patrick lies on the ground, bawling, as SpongeBob gets in the car]
Mrs. Squarepants: Come on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. [Patrick holds onto the back of the boat, lifting the front into the air, as he cries]
Squidward: [still dancing] SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving! [the seed shakes violently] La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha! [the seed shakes even more violently] He leaving, ha ha! [seed still shakes] SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! [Squidward stops dancing as the ground starts shaking, a giant green stem grows out of the ground, SpongeBob's house grows from the plant and drops where his old house used to be and on Squidward. The stem then goes back into the ground]
SpongeBob: My house is back! [SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick all happily run into the pineapple] Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! [continues praising all of the returned belongings he possessed in his original house. SpongeBob returns to Squidward lying under the floor] Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
Squidward: [muffled] Forever?
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man, with his young associate Barnacle Boy, fights for all creatures who live in the sea, against the forces of evil.
Villain: [holds a baby's lollipop and he spots the whirlpool] Oh, no! The Raging Whirlpool! [the whirlpool catches him and the lollipop falls on the baby's tongue]
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man! Champion of the deep.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
SpongeBob: [dressed up as Mermaid Man] Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
Patrick: [dressed up as Barnacle Boy] Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man! I'm right behind you!
[SpongeBob and Patrick outside and sneak behind Squidward, who's relaxing on a lounge chair wearing sunglasses]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good.
Squidward: SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You know what this means.
Patrick: Donuts.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooohh.
SpongeBob: By the power of Neptune. [Patrick bites into the donut]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite!
SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble! [both go into deep thinking] Think... harder... Barnacle Boy. [jellyfish swims by] Here they come. [Squidward blows jellyfish away]
SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful.
Squidward: [under a tent] What the? Ohh!
SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
Patrick: Jumping jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!
[Cut to Squidward destroying the tent in a fury]
SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man.
Squidward: [runs to the door and he knocks it hard] SpongeBob! SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: [Squidward continues knocking the door] Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend.
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover.
Squidward: Yeah... now please leave me alone.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick bites into the donut again] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite! [At Shady Shoals Retirement Home]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
Manager: Undercover? Yeah... well, I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you. [SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing as they walk in] There they are. Right over there. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
Manager: Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick: [holding onto SpongeBob] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk in front of the TV]
Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: Well, we used to be. But now we're retired.
SpongeBob: But you can't retire! There's evil afoot!
Mermaid Man: Wha? Evil! Evil! [hanging on a coral pot] Barnacle Boy! Come quick! I've got the evil!
SpongeBob: All I said was, there's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: Evil! Evil! E...
Barnacle Boy: Would you please stop saying that?
Mermaid Man: [hanging on a water fountain] Evil! Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil! [water squirts at him] Death raaaaay! [the manager comes, grabs SpongeBob and Patrick and throws them out]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. [real life captain gives a thumbs up and triumphant music plays] The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. [fireworks appear]
Patrick: Ooh! Pretty lights!
[At Shady Shoals Retirement Home's cafeteria]
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf! [Receives a slice of meatloaf into his bowl] To the broccoli! [Receives some broccoli into his bowl. Mermaid Man looks at the cafeterian.] Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
Cafeterian: Here you go, son. Haha.
Mermaid Man: To the table, away!
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us?
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut... will you stop calling me "boy"?
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. [jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating] And he globs onto the undersea dome. [puts his mouth on the table] And he starts sucking on the glass. [an old fish moves his oatmeal away from SpongeBob in disgust]
Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?
SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Manager: [enters the cafeteria] What is going on in here?
Mermaid Man: [points to SpongeBob, who stops smiling] You may kiss the bride! [SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home]
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm married. [Back at the retirement home]
Mermaid Man: [he and Barnacle Boy are in rocking chairs] Up, up, and away. Up, up, and away.
SpongeBob: [dressed up as a woman and speaking in a Southern accent] Oh, mah. This purse is so big and heavy.
Patrick: [dressed up as a robber] Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that. [grabs SpongeBob's purse]
SpongeBob: [screams] Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
Patrick: It's working.
SpongeBob: [Barnacle Boy comes over to him] Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
Barnacle Boy: [yells at SpongeBob, ruining his makeup] Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
SpongeBob: [approaches Mermaid Man, who is sleeping with his eyes open] Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open.
Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him!
Mermaid Man: [wakes up] Stop shoutin'! I'm nappin'!
Barnacle Boy: [close up to his face] It's not me, you ol' coot!
Retired Elderly #1: Yes.
Retired Elderly #2: That's me.
Retired Elderly #3: I'm over here.
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile. [The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.]
Barnacle Boy: Gah! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: Evil! Where is it?
Barnacle Boy: There it is! [points at SpongeBob and Patrick] You know what this means? [opens up a box with shiny rings]
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother.
[Barnacle Boy puts the ring on Mermaid Man and then they try to put both of the rings together, but they miss. Superhero sequence fails. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy wave their arms around up and down to synchronize their positioning of their arms. So then they attempt to unite both of the rings together a second time. Both rings are successfully put together but the superhero sequence fails again.]
Barnacle Boy: Say the oath.
Mermaid Man: [in his young voice] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! [unite sequence succeeds while their rings are united together] Throw a waterball at 'em!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Waterballs! Waterballs! [Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob, but nothing happens]
Patrick: Hehehehehe.
Barnacle Boy: Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Dogpaddle away! [they swim around SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: It's the Raging Whirlpool. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer as the whirlpool consumes them]
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, unite! [they summon the sea creatures, but they are retired, so they come slowly]
Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures, attack!
SpongeBob: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [sea creatures, now carrying torches and pitchforks, pick up SpongeBob and Patrick] Mission accomplished, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah, we did it. [sea creatures throw them out]
Mermaid Man: I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot. [they shake hands]
Mermaid Man: Who are you? [Barnacle Boy becomes annoyed]
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers.]
[Mermaid Man places a black checker on the board. A "Pow!" pow-bubble appears. Barnacle Boy replies by placing a red checker on the board. "Clack!" appears. Mermaid Man sweats, then places a black checker to the end of the board. A "King Me!" appears. Suddenly the phone rings.]
Mermaid Man: It's the Aquaphone! [he holds the phone upside down] What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello? [Hangs up phone. "HANG UP!" appears] The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. ["SIT!" appears]
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: All thanks to you. [SpongeBob winks; "WINK!" appears].
Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Clay: Hmmm... uhh... oh, I'll have a... [Squidward takes out a pencil and a paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Maybe... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and  the paper away] Hmmm... I'll have... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. Or maybe...
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
Clay: I'll have a Krabby Patty. [Squidward writes down order]
Squidward: How original.
Clay: And with extra onions.
Squidward: Daring today, aren't we? [takes order and shows SpongeBob] One Krabby Patty, extra onions. [SpongeBob takes piece of paper and puts with the rest of the orders]
SpongeBob: One cryin' Johnny comin' up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! [bell rings]
Squidward: Whatever. [John comes up and tells Squidward what he wants and Squidward relays order to SpongeBob] Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! [SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate]
SpongeBob: [at rapid speed] Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! [Squidward takes the plate]
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. [gives the plate to John] It's been a thrill serving you.
John: Can I get some extra salt?
Squidward: We're all out.
John: Could you check?
Squidward: No. [John glares at Squidward as he leaves. Bubble Bass walks up to order] Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?
Bubble Bass: I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. [Squidward gives up writing all of that down]
Squidward: We serve food here, sir. [SpongeBob shows Squidward he has already gotten the order done]
SpongeBob: I got it already, Squidward. [gasps] Bubble Bass!
Bubble Bass: [pushes Squidward away] SquarePants! [walks to SpongeBob] I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [staring at Bubble Bass] Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
Bubble Bass: Yep.
SpongeBob: Well then... here ya go! [Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he examines the Krabby Patty until he decides to take a bite] Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles! [shows no pickles on the patty]
Crowd: [gasp]
SpongeBob: No!
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don't think so. You lose! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [checks patty for pickles] But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! [customers are disappointed; tears the patty apart, finding the pickles] Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? [Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs, but also throws Squidward out of the way again]
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. [points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money-back guarantee']
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? [takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it]
Bubble Bass: No.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls money back] How about a discount on restroom tokens? [Bubble Bass takes money back]
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.
Mr. Krabs: How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it! [Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money] No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No! [walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! [SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! [Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right! [starts a new patty] Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No! [tries again] Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go? [tries again and uses the same bun] Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it! [tries again] Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no! [Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? What? [SpongeBob walks out and goes home]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... [looks up and notices door is not there] The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! [Mr. Krabs opens door a couple feet away] Oh. [laughs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain. [walks out] Uhh, which way do I live? [Mr. Krabs points the path] Of course. [laughs. Later, we see SpongeBob in his house trying to write down the formula] No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? [throws paper and pencil away] I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight. [at night]
SpongeBob: Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... [hits his head with his fist] D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. [gets in between the two mattresses] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn't right. [he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn't right either. [SpongeBob lays down on his back] Nope. [SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder] Nuh-uh. [tries sleeping with a mattress on his head] Negative. [tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses] C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. [tries in the lifesaver] Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet! [keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning and the rooster crows where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is under all three mattresses on the floor] Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm where it is still going off. At The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [there is black smoke coming from kitchen. Squidward clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher] Patties are done. [Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated]
Mr. Krabs: Urrgh! [Turns backwards from the counter after hearing customers starting to complain]
Unknown Anchovy: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.
Martha: He burnt my fries!
Billy: [Briefly drinks his burnt shake until realizing it is burnt.] He burnt my shake!
All customers: [all yelling and mumbling]
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
[cuts to SpongeBob's house, he nailed a toaster to the door]
Mr. Krabs: [opens door] SpongeBob?
[music playing in reverse; the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [now he has underwear on his head] Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin' funny, lad? [takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: I anything can't do right since because pickles.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
SpongeBob: I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: But you're fine, me boy! [SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door] Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not. [walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table] All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: I how do that?
Mr. Krabs: It's like riding a bike. You never forget! [notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove] Uhh... I'm gonna help ya! [shown both of them sitting on the ground in SpongeBob's living room] If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. [takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. [SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. [Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up] I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!
Mr. Krabs: Don't talk like that!
SpongeBob: Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! [Makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients] I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! [notices the Krabby Patty he just made, was in the correct order]
Mr. Krabs: It's time.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rescued Squidward from the burning kitchen and extinguishes him, too.]
Unnamed fish: Hey, SpongeBob's back! [men and women are cheering]
Bubble Bass: I hear SquarePants is back! [SpongeBob opens the kitchen door]
SpongeBob: I'm right here, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. [spits a loogie into a bucket]
SpongeBob: This is where I belong! [holds up bubbles and blows one] .
Bubble Bass:  [Gives a weird sounding roar]
SpongeBob: Rawr.
[The crowd gasps. SpongeBob and Bubble Bass glare at each other, while Mr. Krabs is sweating with anticipation]
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular. And this time, don't forget the pickles.
SpongeBob: [rushes into the kitchen and comes back with a Krabby Patty in the blink of an eye] I didn't.
[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty]
Bubble Bass: Hmm... ...Still no pickles! [SpongeBob notices] See? [sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is getting sick at the sight of it and they’re disgusted] You failed again, SpongeBob LoserPants! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! [grabs Bubble Bass' tongue and pulls it out] Look! [shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue] He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
Mr. Krabs: And there's the pickles from last time, too!
Shubie: And there's my car keys! [everyone walks up to Bubble Bass, all glaring at him]
Bubble Bass: And... there's my ride! [runs out the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! [Squidward smiles] Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Squidward is shocked and frowns. The frown becomes more droopier with each "Boo"]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Scene changes to outside of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
Customer: Boo! You stink!
Narrator: Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This weeks hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps] [shaking nervously]...SpongeBob...! [SpongeBob moves his desk between two rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.
Jimmy: Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Ohh... Phil?
Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor.
Tina: Hey, I've done it three times already! [SpongeBob moves up closer]
Mrs. Puff: B...uh...B-Beth!
Student: She graduated!
Mrs. Puff: Henry?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Vera?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Clayton?! [SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs] Alright, I guess I have no choice. [gulps] The hall monitor of the day is [she sighs] SpongeBob. [SpongeBob launches into the air]
SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
Mrs. Puff: Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him uniform]
SpongeBob: I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
Mrs. Puff: You can't make this easy, can you?
SpongeBob: Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Give me a break.
SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... [clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point almost everyone, is asleep] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears." [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform] ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! [walks towards the door then turns around] Oh, and I will be re... [bell rings as all students run over SpongeBob]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid so.
SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. [takes off his uniform] I hardly knew ya. [gives uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
SpongeBob: A-hoo! [dives into the uniform] Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I've just done? [cut to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. Then notices a broken traffic light]
SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
Fred: My leg! My leg!
SpongeBob: On patrol. I'm on patrol. [notices a house with an open window] Uh-oh, an open window. [peeks through the window and there is a couple eating]
Vera: More seaweed medley, dear?
SpongeBob: The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. [jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so] I'm the open window maniac! [both run out screaming] I hope you learned a valuable lesson! [shuts the window and begins walking again] On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... [gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground] Vandals! Another crime. [takes his finger and tastes the pink goo] hmm...strawberry! I must act! [more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick eating some strawberry ice cream] Patrick... [looks around for the voice he just heard] Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick: My ice cream! It's alive! [screams and throws away the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. [Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm down here.
Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's hall monitor to you!
Patrick: Sorry, officer.
SpongeBob: Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
Patrick: What crime? [shows him the ice cream that is on the ground] I'm a bad person! [cries]
Newspaper Boy: [High Voice] Extra! Extra! "Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!" City paralyzed with fear! [gives one to SpongeBob] [Gruff Voice] Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. [runs off] [High voice again] Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Patrick: [still crying] I wanna be good!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Patrick: Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream]
SpongeBob: Okay, now what?
Patrick: Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream]
SpongeBob: This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy] And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick]
Officer Rob: Afternoon, son.
Patrick: Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat]
Officer Rob: Son, we're looking for the maniac.
Officer John: Have you seen THIS MAN?! [He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.]
Patrick: [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away!
Officer Rob: Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand?
Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh.
Officer Rob: Okay. [Officer John shows Patrick the poster again]
Patrick: [screams] Horrible!
[Officer John removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Officer John repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.]
Officer Rob: Stay indoors, son.
Officer John: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off]
Patrick: [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared!
SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie, sobbing] I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
Patrick: Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark.
SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it] [gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick?
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign]
SpongeBob: That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
Patrick: Uhh, he's just standing there... MENACINGLY! [screams over walkie-talkie] GET OUT OF THERE, SPONGEBOB! [SpongeBob screams] THAT'S HIS MANIAC SHRIEK! HE'S GOING TO ATTACK! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! RUN! HIDE BEHIND THAT BUILDING! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] NO, HE'S BEHIND THAT BUILDING! OH, QUICK, HIDE BEHIND THAT STREET SIGN! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] NO WAIT! THE MANIAC JUST WENT BEHIND THAT SIGN! QUICK! GET UNDER THE STREET LIGHT! [SpongeBob gets under the street lights] NO WAIT, AGH, HE'S THERE, TOO! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out]
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy?
Patrick: THE MANIAC'S IN THE MAILBOX! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through three buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plasted with wanted posters]
SpongeBob: [takes a look at a wanted poster] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams in the background and a mass of police cars surround SpongeBob]
Officer Durado: We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! [SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words]
Officer #1: You know this guy?
Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. [the cops glare at her] Uh-oh... [at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV] And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now! [jail closure sound]
Narrator: Ah, Jellyfish Fields. Here we find SpongeBob once again stalking the wild jellyfish. SpongeBob? Hello? SpongeBob? Hmmm... he's supposed to be here somewhere... [narrator sees a square-shaped coral] A-ha! [Jellyfish floats by. SpongeBob puts his glasses on]
SpongeBob: Safety first. [SpongeBob captures a jellyfish] A-ha! I finally gotcha! [SpongeBob grabs a wooden stool and sits on it. Puts on a farmer hat and 'milks' the jellyfish. Jelly comes out and squirts on a piece of bread. The jellyfish moos like a cow. He eats.] Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later! [walks off but jellyfish floats towards him with his glasses] Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye! [the jellyfish floats with SpongeBob] I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home. [jellyfish hangs onto SpongeBob's nose] No. You can't go home with me. [jellyfish walks behind him. The jellyfish's steps are squeaking, like SpongeBob's] Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey! [puts the jellyfish on a rock] Stay! [walks backwards] Stay... [jellyfish floats around SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs the jellyfish and uses a slingshot to launch him somewhere else but the jellyfish ends up on his back. The jellyfish giggles. SpongeBob pulls the jellyfish off] [exasperated] Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me! [SpongeBob looks at the jellyfish sternly. The jellyfish deflates as if he was sad. SpongeBob decides to keep him] Ahh, what the heck! [SpongeBob, with the jellyfish on a rope, like a dog, walk by Squidward's house] Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard! [Squidward peeks out his window] Squidward! Look at my new pet!
Squidward: That's no pet, that's a wild animal.
SpongeBob: No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch! [throws a stick so the jellyfish returns it. SpongeBob is holding up three fingers] How many fingers am I holding up? [the jellyfish hums deeply three times] Play dead! [jellyfish is buried underground with a tomb that says "R.I.P.". He pops up]
Squidward: I wouldn't let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained! [the jellyfish, still on the rope, is on a toilet reading a newspaper as he hums casually] I didn't need to see that.
SpongeBob: Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.
Squidward: How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish? [SpongeBob and the jellyfish dance to some music. Also, various colors change as they dance. Disco lights rotate around the room. SpongeBob's house is vibrating from the music] SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... for 12 hours!
SpongeBob: [stops dancing. He is exhausted, sees the jellyfish dance more] Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed. [as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on] Huh? [walks over to turn the music off] You got it all wrong, little fella. [as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on. SpongeBob turns it back off] Bed. Repeat after me. [SpongeBob ties the rope around the jellyfish] Bed! [upstairs, SpongeBob ties the rope around his bedpost] We'll just keep you right here.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night, everybody. [as he is sleeping throughout the night, other jellyfish float inside the pineapple]
Gary: Meow. [jellyfish opens the window, and the 4 jellyfish talking in jellyfish speaking] Meow. [gets squirted with jelly from all the jellyfish, they laugh at Gary, and continue squirting jelly on him] Meow. [More jellyfish enter SpongeBob's House. It's now daytime and the rooster crows everyone up]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary. Good morning, jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly! [puts on his green robe and goes to check downstairs]
Gary: [Follows SpongeBob to the doorway] Meow.
SpongeBob:  Oh, jellyfi-! [slips on some jelly. Opens a door leading into his living room and sees jellyfish dancing to music. The jellyfish are having a dance party.] Where'd you all come from? [jellyfish form a figure of a hand and the hand grabs SpongeBob. They stick over a light bulb like a disco ball and spin him. Then falls to the ground] Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome. [As SpongeBob is walking to the stereo, jellyfish form a flight of stairs that SpongeBob walks up and falls off of] This music is way too loud. [jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a triangle] Very funny. [jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a rectangle] I'm serious! [Jellyfish carry SpongeBob up and down the screen. The scene then goes to SpongeBob's house bouncing up and down because of the loud party. Squidward's house. Squidward is still lying in his bed, holding a pillow against his face. He has not slept all night.]
Squidward: Grr! 18 hours! [falls off his bed, picks up the phone and dials SpongeBob's number] I'm gonna give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind!
Jellyfish: [Cut back to the party. Jellyfish picks up the phone.] [garbled] Hello?
Squidward: SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears! I've had enough of this! [Jelly squirts through the phone and onto Squidward's face] Strawberry. [Squidward plays his clarinet outside his window] Two can play at this! [plays his clarinet badly. Jellyfish form a smiley face.]
SpongeBob: Come on, guys, enough is enough! [SpongeBob hears the clarinet music in the distance.] Huh? [Cuts back to the Jellyfish's smile, but this time, turns into an angry frown when Squidward plays his clarinet] Uh-oh! [Jellyfish sting SpongeBob] Hey, take it easy! Ow! Okay, I'll talk to him! [SpongeBob peeks his head out his window] Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it.
Squidward: The jellyfish don't like...? [sarcastically] Why, sure, pal, I can play better.
SpongeBob: Okay, he said he'll play better. [Squidward's house rotates slowly towards SpongeBob's house. He has a giant amp set behind him. In front of him is a microphone. Squidward inhales deeply as his house stretches, then he plays his clarinet extremely loudly.] Uh-oh! That's not better! [Jellyfish knocks SpongeBob's coral plant over] Hey! Take it easy with that! [The jellyfish knock over his television] Those are my things! [The jellyfish knock over a wall decoration] Don't break th- Dow! [The jellyfish float out of the party and into Squidward's house]
Squidward:  Uhh, w-wait, I can turn it down. Ow! Ow! Ow! [the jellyfish sting Squidward and float back into SpongeBob's house, returning to their party. A welt-covered Squidward walks up to the door and gives SpongeBob his clarinet] Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore.
SpongeBob: Hey, now, that wasn't nice! [jellyfish take the clarinet and snap it in half. A fire forms and they dance around it in a circle. Boat horn toots as SpongeBob finally reaches his breaking point.] Okay, that is it! Everybody out! [He grabs the stereo and runs toward the door but the jellyfish try to take it back so they can party more. Both sides accidentally let go and the stereo falls to floor and shatters into pieces with a crash causing the music to stop. SpongeBob gulps and the jellyfish start to quiver, due to the loss of the music, thus ending their party. SpongeBob stammers. The jellyfish get angry and sting SpongeBob] Come on, Gary! [SpongeBob and Gary head up to the roof. SpongeBob's house vibrates forcefully, and the jellyfish start to swarm around the house.] Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in. [SpongeBob looks scared and his teeth chatter. Gary clicks his eyes together making a beat that the jellyfish can dance to] Huh? They stopped? [holds Gary's eyes together and the jellyfish get angry again. Then he lets go of Gary's eyes and they dance again. Does this a couple more times and notices a trend] Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it! [takes Gary to Jellyfish Fields. Along the way, SpongeBob has other creatures and things join in the rhythm. Eventually, he gets the jellyfish back home to Jellyfish Fields and he runs back to his home]
Narrator: Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea's harshest lessons: wild animals can throw very wild parties. [SpongeBob shakes Gary's eye, congratulating him. Squidward sinks down into his bubble bath as he groans in pain] Ooh, I felt that.
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy! [While knocking on her door, a spaceship comes up from underneath the ground at the left side of the tree dome] Wow! [Sandy peeks her head out of a spaceship window]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around.
SpongeBob: [Sandy rides an elevator on the bottom floor and meets SpongeBob downstairs] Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
Sandy: [pointing to a poster of the moon] I'm going to the moon, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The moon! Can I go?
Sandy: No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird. [shown a graveyard of dead animals] Besides, there's not enough room for you.
SpongeBob: But I don't take up that much space! [squishes himself into a little square] See? [downsizes himself to fit into a little drawer] I can fit in here. [closes the drawer] Mmm, cozy.
Sandy: I need that drawer.
SpongeBob: Well, how about... [jumps into a test tube] This? [jumps into another test tube] Or this? [jumps into another test tube] Or this?
Sandy: SpongeBob, this isn't for fun. [shows her clipboard with math equations on it] See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. [SpongeBob is behind a set of bars]
SpongeBob: Fine. [deep voice] Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
Sandy: That's the air vent, SpongeBob. [pushes a button to turn the air vent on that blows SpongeBob out of it] I need that, too.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
Sandy: All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
SpongeBob: [running around the ship] Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!
Sandy: [grabs SpongeBob] But this time, just don't touch anything, okay? [Cuts to Sandy pumping a gun and SpongeBob comes to watch her]
SpongeBob: Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
Sandy: Aww, hush, silly. [shoots her gun and 3 gray nets cover a couple items] This is for harvesting moon rocks.
SpongeBob: Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
Sandy: Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores? [walks around and forms a circle around him and Sandy with his shoes] And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night? [sees a circle] Ah! There's one now!
Sandy: SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind.
SpongeBob: [trying to sleep. Checks the clock every few seconds] Oh, hurry up! [grabs two clothes pins and puts them on his eyelids] These oughta do the trick.
Patrick: [Sitting in the window] Hi ya, SpongeBob! [clothes pins shoot off his eyes]
SpongeBob: What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
Patrick: Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.
SpongeBob: A present?
Patrick: No. Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?
SpongeBob: There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
Patrick: [shows a spray can] Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!
SpongeBob: Alien repellent? Let me see that. [looks at the can] New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the rocket]
Patrick: Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: It's pretty impressive, all right.
Patrick: Come on! [both head for the rocket]
SpongeBob: We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
Patrick: Wow. How do you think we get inside? [pulls a level that says "open"]
SpongeBob: We don't, we're just spraying the... [door opens on SpongeBob] ...windows.
Patrick: I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on! [both walk inside] Holy sea cow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
SpongeBob: Yeah, just don't touch anything. [Patrick starts playing with everything]
Patrick: Look, I'm winning!
SpongeBob: Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun... [SpongeBob turns around and looks at himself as thin in the mirror] ...house?
Patrick: Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
Patrick: I don't know! [notices a lever above his head] But let's see what this does!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think we should... [Patrick pulls a lever and the two launch off the seat out of the rocket]
Patrick: I like rockets. [both fall back into the rocket]
Patrick: More! More!
SpongeBob: No more! [Patrick presses a button and both shake a lot then stop] Okay, one more. [shake again] Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
Patrick: Oh, wait, I think this one starts it. [SpongeBob stops Patrick from pushing a button]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here. [presses the engine button and the ship starts up and is blasting off]
Patrick: We've started the rocket!
Sandy: [notices the smoke] Oh, SpongeBob... [SpongeBob and Patrick hold onto each other while the ship is taking off]
Patrick: Hold on, buddy! [while screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick are falling down to the bottom of the ship. The ship enters space and both of them start to float] Hey, we stopped falling!
SpongeBob: Look! [points at the dark galaxy] We're in space now! Wee! [both float around in the ship]
Patrick: Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something! [SpongeBob laughs as the ship is going around the moon] Hey, SpongeBob, watch this! [squirts toothpaste into some peanut butter]
SpongeBob: Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter! [SpongeBob lifts a heavy weight on one finger] Patrick, I can do this! [the ship is landing back into the sea and the heavy weight hurls into the ground and flattens SpongeBob's hand]
Patrick: Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
SpongeBob: We must be landing.
Patrick: All right! [Sandy uses her jetpack to fly up to the moon]
Sandy: Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. [the ship is now in Bikini Bottom. While Sandy searches for SpongeBob and Patrick on the moon, these two get out of the ship]
Patrick: Wow, it sure looks a lot like home. [Patrick sees Gary asleep] Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
SpongeBob: Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
Patrick: So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...
SpongeBob: Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it! [SpongeBob captures Gary with a gray net-like substance] Yeah!
Patrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
SpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me! [grabs Gary] Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! [tosses Gary into the ship. Ship's number increases from 00 to 01; ding from "The Price Is Right"]
Patrick: Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
SpongeBob: Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to. [whispering to Patrick] Make sure your gun is pumped. [go in and see Squidward sleeping] Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting. [Squidward moves his arms and legs around then puts them back down. He mutters in his sleep and all we can understand is the word "Grandma"] It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. [SpongeBob takes the covers off. Squidward is wearing a pink floral top]
Patrick: Wait, what's that? [SpongeBob takes a red bag out from underneath Squidward. It appears to be a hot water bottle] I think I'm gonna be sick.
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
Patrick: Stinky.
SpongeBob: No, it's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo. [Patrick puts flashlight under the so-called "egg sack" and SpongeBob's hands are under it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Twins. [Squidward rolls over in his sleep and his right tentacle sticks on Patrick's helmet]
Patrick: Pardon my French, but get this thing off me! [SpongeBob and Patrick try to get his tentacles off but they wake him up instead]
Squidward: Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Patrick: It's awake!
SpongeBob: Let's capture the little phony! [Squidward screams]
Squidward: Get away from me! [runs away while SpongeBob and Patrick try to capture him. Outside, Mr. Krabs walks up with his pet worm and notices Squidward's house shaking. SpongeBob and Patrick come out with Squidward captured]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye? [laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick point their guns at his head] Wait! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
SpongeBob: We don't want your money, moon man! [both capture Mr. Krabs and toss him and Squidward into the ship] Look at them squirming around in there.
Patrick: Eww, gross.
SpongeBob: Well, there's plenty more where those came from. [at Boating School]
Mrs. Puff: [grading some of her students' paper] SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late? [captured] Whatever this is... [inflates herself and has a deep voice] ...it's going on your permanent record! [Flats, a woman, and Larry are captured along with all of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick are run out of room in the ship for everyone]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
SpongeBob: There's no time for that! Just push harder. [Sandy is on her jetpack floating down]
Sandy: SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of... [SpongeBob and Patrick capture her]
SpongeBob: Nice try, Sandy.
Patrick: Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. [laughs]
Sandy: Aliens? Is that what this is about? [SpongeBob and Patrick throw her into the ship] This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot-- [door is slammed shut]
SpongeBob: It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone. [both stare at each other and pump their guns] So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
Patrick: I didn't even know!
SpongeBob: Yeah? Well, I got you now.
Patrick: Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's... [Patrick catches himself with the gray netting as it turns out he had his gun pointed the wrong way] ...me that's got me!
SpongeBob: Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this! [ship runs out of gas and stops on the moon] Sandy, I'm back! [peeks out the window] Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different. [sees the Earth and realizes his mistake] Uh-oh...
Everyone else: SpongeBob, we "aliens" would like a word with you!
Mr. Krabs: [dancing and singing at Pearl's birthday party] ♪Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar!♪ Ta-da!
Pearl: Thanks for the show, Dad. Now can we open the presents?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. Here ya are. [places the present in front of Pearl]
Pearl: Oh, you shouldn't have. What is it, Daddy? It wouldn't be those totally hip new flipper slippers all my friends are wearing, would it? Everyone wants them.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...they might be.
Pearl: Whee! [begins to unwrap present] Oh, you shouldn't have, yay, you shouldn't have. [sees present] I mean, Dad, [holds up big boots] you really shouldn't have! [Pearl's friends laugh]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!
Pearl: Dad, you ruined me! [cries]
Mr. Krabs: But I got them for a bargain! [the house shakes from Pearl's screaming and wailing; bubble transitions to the Krusty Krab] Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!
SpongeBob: [peeks into Mr. Krabs' office] Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots. [SpongeBob sits down, but the boots are in his way, so he can't see Mr. Krabs] So you want to get paid?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots [leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other] are in [leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other] the way.
Mr. Krabs: [pushes the boots aside] In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
Mr. Krabs: Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.
SpongeBob: ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable. [takes boots away]
SpongeBob: Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: Paycheck! You got a deal--
SpongeBob: And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
Mr. Krabs: You've got a deal.
SpongeBob: And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
Mr. Krabs: You got a...
SpongeBob: And... [Mr. Krabs stops SpongeBob from saying anything else]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] You got yourself a deal.
[Squidward is drying off a glass when he looks through the glass and sees SpongeBob wearing boots]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!
[SpongeBob bounces up and down in the boots, making them squeak, as Squidward watches. Then SpongeBob bounces harder until Squidward's head is bouncing up and down really hard trying to keep up. Then SpongeBob leaves to squeak his boots around the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music.
[Later that night, Mr. Krabs is in his room, lying in his hammock and imagining dollar bills jumping one-by-one into a cash register]
Mr. Krabs: [muttering] Money, money, money, money, money. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty... [all of a sudden, the pair of squeaky boots jumps into the register. He opens his eyes] Wha? Who's there? [rests his head on his pillow] Back to countin' me money. [closes his eyes again and imagines coins jumping into the register] One, two, three, four, five... [the boots appear again; Mr. Krabs opens his eyes again] What the barnacle is that? [he sees that the bedroom window is opening and shutting by itself, making squeaky noises. Mr. Krabs closes the window and gets back into bed, but notices the window has opened again. He walks back across the room to close it but steps into a hole and falls out the window, breaking the tip of his leg off in the process. He gets back into his bedroom, watches his step to avoid another hole and shuts the window, but it won't close. He starts shutting it with increasing force and speed until the window finally stays closed. The window reopens again, and Mr. Krabs gives it the "evil eye" followed by a growl. The window immediately closes back, as if it says "Yipe!" Mr. Krabs then starts to go back to bed, but he steps into the same hole he avoided earlier and breaks the tip of his other leg off. He screams as he gets flung into his hammock and gets all twisted up in it. Mr. Krabs can do nothing but lie there with bloodshot eyes as the window makes squeaky noises all night, as if it is clapping at him. Fade to the next morning; Mr. Krabs has his legs bandaged up as he drowsily walks to the Krusty Krab] Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work. [As he walks up to the door, Squidward slams the doors open into Mr. Krabs' face]
Squidward: That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now.
Mr. Krabs: [muffled] What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?
Squidward: I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week. [leaves the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob. [every time SpongeBob's boots squeak, Mr. Krabs stutters. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, but he is so tall, all Mr. Krabs can see is his boots]
Mr. Krabs: I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots.
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this? [runs in place fast with plates of Krabby Patties in each hand]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh...
SpongeBob: Or could he do this? [leans over to one table and sets the plate on the table without having to move from his spot at all] Or this? [leans to another table and puts a plate of patties on that table, then goes behind the register on top of the boat] And watch this, Mr. Krabs! [moves his boots around slightly, making them "talk"]
Squeaky Boots: May I take your order?
Francis: Yeah, I'll have the Krusty Special.
Squeaky Boots: Thank you, sir. I will squeak when it's ready.
SpongeBob: Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I, uhh...
SpongeBob: And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. [does many different things with his boots until Mr. Krabs can't take it anymore]
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes go bloodshot] [screaming] I gotta go to my office! [puts seat cushions over his ears] I can still hear it! [puts chairs over his ears] It's still coming through! The infernal squeak! [he repeatedly bangs his head on his desk] Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin.
[that night, at SpongeBob's pineapple...]
SpongeBob: Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off.
Gary: [puts earplugs in] Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary.
[as SpongeBob is sleeping with his boots on, Mr. Krabs peeks over his diving board and climbs down, then takes his boots off and runs to the Krusty Krab, laughing quietly. Some hammering sounds are heard, then a rooster crows as night fades to morning]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quiet money. Silence and money. [SpongeBob bursts through the double doors]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What is it, my boy?
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs while crying] Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, son.
SpongeBob: [cries harder and looks up at his boss with tears streaming down his face] No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Mr. Krabs: Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world.
SpongeBob: Yes, it is!
Mr. Krabs: Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts! [holds up some oven mitts]
SpongeBob: [puts them on his feet, waits a second, then kicks them off] They're not the same! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots. [walks into the door, opens it, then goes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Poor lad. [looks through the window and sees that SpongeBob is so upset, he has his head down... right on top of the hot grill]
Tom: Excuse me?
Mr. Krabs: I didn't do it! [sees Tom] Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?
Tom: Yeah, I'm ready to order.
Mr. Krabs: [takes out a notepad] What'll ya have?
Tom: I'll take a [squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: [becomes surprised] What did you say?
Tom: I said, I'll take a [squeak].
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob: [still in tears] I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants [squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: What?
Tom: And a [squeak squeak squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [starts going insane, imagining everything and everyone squeaking] Huh? [looks at the menu and sees "squeak" as an item for everything] I didn't write that! [keeps thinking and hearing the squeaks. Even the dripping kitchen sink makes squeaking sounds instead of dripping sounds. Eventually he starts seeing visions of SpongeBob and his boots.]
SpongeBob: [in Mr. Krabs' head] Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this... [Mr. Krabs' eye starts swirling]
Mr. Krabs: [snaps] Stop it! [the customers look at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] Stop... it! [his eyes start contorting] Oh, oh, don't you hear it?! Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboards! [sobbing] Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots! [throws himself onto the floor and bawls] I'm sorry! But I can't take the infernal squeakin' no more! [lifts up the Krusty Krab and grabs the boots, with everyone screaming inside. He then walks into the kitchen with an evil expression on his face and puts the boots into a vat of grease, which shrinks them, and he eats them. After that, he opens the door to the dining room, and lets out a long burp] The deed is done.
SpongeBob: Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.
SpongeBob: You really think so, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I do, son. [hands SpongeBob a stack of money] Here's the paycheck I owe you. [puts another stack of money on top of the first stack] Plus a bonus! [takes the bonus back] Well, there's your paycheck anyway. [walks away] I need a vacation.
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!
[fade to Mr. Krabs and Pearl taking a drive out to somewhere, with a camper behind their boat]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
Pearl: [lifts her feet over the side of the door to reveal her new shoes] Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Darling, I won't. [as he laughs, he hiccups and the squeaky noise comes out] Oh, no. [continues to hiccup and squeak as they drive off into the distance]
Narrator: Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties. [lights go off and sirens and red lights blare as everyone in the Krusty Krab screams and runs for cover] Huh?! What's this? [doors and windows are now metal]
Mr. Krabs: Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [up in a crows nest with a telescope] Down there, sir! [a Krabby Patty is bouncing to the door]
Narrator: [gasps] There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress! [Krabby Patty shoots a laser hole big enough for it to go through at the door] There can only be one culprit: Plankton!
Plankton: Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win! [laughs]
Squidward: He got away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: [devastated] No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!
Narrator: Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's... [SpongeBob tears himself into another SpongeBob and flies off] ...SpongeBob SquarePants! [later, SpongeBob peeks out through under the sewer with binoculars in his hand. Catches a peek at a Krabby Patty jumping through the crowd]
SpongeBob: A-ha! [chases it behind some buildings] Hey! [Plankton flies up with a propeller. SpongeBob takes the twirling club that the cop is using as a propeller and flies after the Krabby Patty to the top of a building] Okay, that's far enough! Huh? [patty jumps off building] Tartar sauce! [uses his hat as a balloon-like ball and jumps off the building. Bounces off the ground towards the Krabby Patty. Bounces past a cowboy and a cowgirl]
Cowboy: Yeehaw! [Plankton walks into a magic shop and comes back out with funny glasses on]
SpongeBob: Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and... [looks up and reads the sign MAGIC SHOP] Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, "If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true." [Plankton takes away Krabby Patty]
Plankton: Argh! I can't take it!
SpongeBob: Plankton! It's you!
Plankton: Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser. [cries]
SpongeBob: Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
Plankton: [stops crying] Wh-what did you say?
SpongeBob: I said, you're a-- [a bunch of people run up and point at Plankton]
All: Loser! [Plankton jumps away from group and walks back to his restaurant]
Squidward: How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!
Policeman: Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day. [puts a big donut with a ribbon on it around SpongeBob]
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, the policeman, Fred, Tammy, Joe, Millie, Ricardo, and Stella: ♪For he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie...♪
[Everyone throws SpongeBob into the air.]
SpongeBob: [thinking to himself] I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.
All: [as SpongeBob comes down, they stop singing] Which no... whatever. [everyone walks away. Later, Plankton hears a knock on his door at his restaurant]
Plankton: A customer? [opens door] Our special today is chum... [sees SpongeBob at the door] ...balaya.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?
SpongeBob: No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Play with me.
Plankton: You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?
SpongeBob: No, but I like to go jelly... [Plankton closes the door]
Plankton: That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?
Karen: You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!
Plankton: Elaborate. [computer shows images of a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob]
Karen: Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Take the Krabby Patty? [runs back to the door]
Karen: Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.
SpongeBob: [Plankton opens the door]  ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
Plankton: Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.
SpongeBob: Great! [SpongeBob grabs Plankton and runs off] Last one to the fields is a rotten clam! [now at Jellyfish Fields] So, I get the big net and you get the little net. [hands Plankton a net bigger than him]
Plankton: What happens after we eat 'em?
SpongeBob: You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this! [captures a jellyfish] Like that.
Plankton: And?
SpongeBob: And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!
Plankton: Stingers? [Plankton imagines ruling Bikini Bottom with a jellyfish that only he controls] All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win! [end of fantasy while laughing]
SpongeBob: It's not about winning, it's about fun!
Plankton: What's that?
SpongeBob: Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...
SpongeBob: What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪
Clams: ♪Down here in the deep blue sea.♪
Plankton: ♪F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-♪
SpongeBob: Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪
Plankton: Never! That's completely idiotic!
SpongeBob: Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it!
Plankton: ♪N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪
Clams: ♪Down here in the deep blue sea!♪
Plankton: Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?
SpongeBob: No! That's how you're suppose to feel!
Plankton: Well, I like it. Let's do it again!
SpongeBob: Okay!
SpongeBob and Plankton: ♪F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, chewing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!♪
[At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is looking through a telescope at SpongeBob and Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, mutiny.
[At the Chum Bucket at night, Plankton is changing clothes.]
Plankton: And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...
Karen: Sounds like fun.
Plankton: Well, the really fun part was when we...
Karen: What did you do with the Krabby Patty?
Plankton: The what? [shows a Krabby Patty on Karen's computer screen]
Karen: The Krabby Patty, remember?
Plankton: You can't rush these things, you know.
Karen: You're forgetting about the mission! [shows a formula]
Plankton: What are you talking about?
Karen: You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself! [metal arm picks up Plankton and shows him wearing square pants like SpongeBob's]
Plankton: What?
[cuts to Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.
SpongeBob: Who knows? Maybe he's changed.
Mr. Krabs: Who knows? I think you knows! [shows a picture of him and Plankton holding up the letters for FUN]
SpongeBob: He's changed, I tell you! [Plankton enters]
Plankton: SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo! [SpongeBob runs over to Plankton]
SpongeBob: Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private. [talking to Plankton] You won't mind if I set this here, will you? [puts a plate with a Krabby Patty on the table and pushes it toward him]
SpongeBob: What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...
SpongeBob: Why can't you just accept our friendship?
Mr. Krabs: He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you. [walks up to Plankton] Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.
Plankton: Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... suit yourself. [walks off then comes back to push the plate closer to Plankton. Uses a fan to get the smell to Plankton]
SpongeBob: We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs! [turns the fan off] Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here. [both walk away]
Mr. Krabs: Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight. [plate falls down revealing that it was cardboard] And maybe scallops will fly out of my pants! [takes the boat and paddles to the movies] Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin! [at the movies, SpongeBob and Plankton are sitting in the front row. SpongeBob is giving popcorn to Plankton as he is eating some himself. Then Bubble Bass comes down and sits on Plankton, squishing him]
SpongeBob: I sure like sequels, Plankton. [sees Bubble Bass in his spot] Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend. [Bubble Bass meanly smiles and gets comfortable in his seat, and a squelching sound comes from Plankton being squashed by his butt] Hey, Bubble Bass! [throws some popcorn and Bubble Bass runs after it]
Plankton: Thanks for that, friend.
SpongeBob: Sure thing.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up! [Mr. Krabs' shadow is on the movie screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? [in the projector room]
Mr. Krabs: He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got! [the ladies didn't understand, so they reach in their husbands pockets and take out a watch, some money and a piggy bank then run off] You too, boy! [SpongeBob reaches into Plankton's pocket and takes out a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I can't believe this!
Plankton: It's not what you think.
SpongeBob: What is it then? Tell me what you see here!
Plankton: I... I don't see anything.
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] How can you not see it!? [groans]
Plankton: [beginning to tear up as well] Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay?! I couldn't help it!
SpongeBob: But we sang The F.U.N. Song! [clutches his stomach] I think I'm gonna be sick! How long?
Plankton: How long what?
SpongeBob: [grabs Plankton, holding him in his fist] How long were you planning on doing this?! [tears well up in SpongeBob's eyes] Tell me!
[Plankton puts his head down and begins to sob.]
SpongeBob: [the tears now dripping down his face] What?!
Plankton: [looks up at SpongeBob] All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship! [the two look each other in the eyes] And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!
SpongeBob: [sniffs, then smiles, beginning to stop crying] Really?
Plankton: [Plankton grabs the patty and jumps towards the screen] No, not really. Being evil is too much fun! [laughs evilly]
Movie Woman: Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart. [Plankton rips through the movie screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.
Mr Krabs: Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete! [laughs. Plankton is squished on the wall groaning. Mr. Krabs takes the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.
Mr. Krabs: Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Well, maybe on a discount. [Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the wall and onto Bubble Bass' jelly beans]
Plankton: Huh? [Plankton runs around Bubble Bass's hand getting chased by his other hand] Yee... AAH!
Squidward: [talking to a wax sculpture of himself] Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided. [takes out the right eye, fixes it then puts it back in place] There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile! [Squidward makes wax sculpture smile. Then he hears a crash from outside and frowns; the sculpture does as well]
SpongeBob: Hike, Patrick, hike! [both run in separate directions but SpongeBob has a big rock. Drops the rock on the ground and it breaks in half while Patrick blows a chess piece across a chessboard] You just lost three points. [climbs a tree branch] One. Two. Five! [flips upside down and blows a bubble into a shape] G-7!
Patrick: G-7? King me! King me! [runs into the coral branch and pops the bubble] I lose!
SpongeBob: But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.
Patrick: Tartar sauce! [Squidward peeks out]
Squidward: Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We don't know.
Squidward: Hey, Patrick, do you know what time it is?
Patrick: Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's... [checks his watch but all the bubble soap leaks out when he turns his wrist around]
Squidward: Time to find some other game to play! [laughs. Turns on the record player while taking a bubble bath]
SpongeBob: Now what?
Patrick: [notices a shell on the ground] We could toss that shell back and forth.
SpongeBob: [picks up shell] Okay... ready! [throws shell into Patrick's belly. Patrick shoots it into the air]
Patrick: Go! [SpongeBob goes after it]
SpongeBob: I got it! I got it! [the shell flies through Squid's open window, knocks into Squid's sculpture, and it falls over] I got it! I got it! I got it! [Squid in the other room, hears a thump, but he ignores it. Sponge and Pat enter the room via the elevator] Remember, Patrick, finders keepers.
Patrick: There it is! [points to the shell that is in the wax sculpture of Squidward]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: I got it! I got it! [Patrick pulls the shell out]
Patrick: Bonus points! [Patrick starts to walk off]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
Patrick: Don't worry. I know how to do this. [Patrick tries to give CPR, but his face turns blue and he floats up to the ceiling but lets out all the air and lands on top of the wax sculpture's head]
SpongeBob: Get off him, Patrick! [Patrick stands up]
Patrick: What are you worried about? [Patrick's butt is now imprinted on the sculpture's face] He looks better already. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick stand him up]
SpongeBob: But he still feels cold.
Patrick: Well, let's go put him in the warm. [they bring the sculpture in front of the window with the sun shining through it]
SpongeBob: Do you think he'll be okay?
Patrick: You know, you worry too much. [the sculpture begins to melt] The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe... [starts to drool as SpongeBob snaps his fingers] ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe? [SpongeBob looks down]
SpongeBob: I don't know.
Patrick: It kind of looks like... [a liquid puddle of green goo is on the floor]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Squidward! [both are screaming as Squidward is powdering his nose]
SpongeBob: No, no, that part goes here.
Patrick: Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh.
SpongeBob: We're almost there. We can do this.
Patrick: It's working, it's working...
SpongeBob: This is working. [sculpture melts again] Patrick, this isn't working!
Patrick: Look! [eyes turn over]
SpongeBob: I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!
Patrick: Oh, I thought he was dead. [Squidward comes out of the bathroom covered in talcum powder. SpongeBob &amp; Patrick cling to each other and get scared]
Squidward: [screams] What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?
SpongeBob: No, stay back!
Squidward: What is the matter with you two?
Patrick: Don't, don't hurt us!
SpongeBob: It was an accident!
Squidward: What are you two talking about? [he notices the goo on the floor and screams] Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost! [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are bowing before Squidward] Spare us your ghostly anger! [Patrick is kissing Squidward's feet]
Patrick: Oh, yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!
SpongeBob: We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us! [Squidward then gets an idea and grins evilly]
Squidward: Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.
SpongeBob: Does that include...
Squidward: Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!
Patrick: [whispers to SpongeBob] I think they make a cream for that now. [SpongeBob and Patrick carry out Squidward on his bed]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Too hot. [walk a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going. [walks a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Toulouse-Lautrec. [rim shot]
SpongeBob: Too tired... [both stop where they are]
Squidward: Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy. [claps his hands] Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.
SpongeBob: Only the freshest, o spooky one. [both run off. SpongeBob comes back with grapes] A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness. [Squidward eats it while SpongeBob goes and gets a banana] A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness. [squeezes it into Squidward's mouth. Patrick comes back with a watermelon]
Patrick: One watermelon... [drops it into Squidward's mouth, who keels over due to the weight] Fresh from the manure fields, your spookiness. [on the ground, Squidward's head is shaped like the watermelon]
SpongeBob: Art thou not pleased? [Squidward spits out the watermelon]
Squidward&#160;: Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.
Patrick&#160;: What do you hunger for, master?
SpongeBob: Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.
Squidward: Cherry pie. [Patrick holds up a cherry pie] Where'd you get that?
Patrick: I found it. [Squidward takes it and throws it somewhere]
Squidward: Well, go find it again! [Patrick goes searching for it] SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around. [SpongeBob turns around] That's better. Now jog in place. [SpongeBob jogs in place] Say "flank steak".
SpongeBob: Flank steak.
Squidward: I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop. [SpongeBob stops] Now, play me an elaborate song with this! [gives SpongeBob a tissue]
SpongeBob: But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
Squidward: Oh, my. Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo. [SpongeBob blows through the tissue to try and get it to make music]
SpongeBob: I can't do it!
Squidward: Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, 'cause you're not allowed to leave that spot till I hear a song. [walks away. Day turns into night and into day again and SpongeBob is lying on the ground with the tissue on his nose] What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.
Patrick: [comes back with the pie] I found it. [Squidward takes it]
Squidward: I'll take that! [throws pie in Patrick's face]
Patrick: Yes, your ghostliness! [licks filling off his face] This is fun.
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you ready for this?
Patrick: Yes. [SpongeBob walks a couple steps forward]
SpongeBob: Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming? [Patrick is facing the wrong way]
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's this way.
Patrick: Where?
SpongeBob: Here.
Patrick: [turns around] Oh, coming! [both enter a room in the back with a bunch of junk in it] How are we going to clean up all this mess?
SpongeBob: It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! [tears the wall]
Patrick: [laughs] Oh look, you missed some. [SpongeBob picks up a book]
SpongeBob: Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman. [shows picture in the book] It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
Patrick: We're going to go shopping?
SpongeBob: No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. [Squidward is laying on the couch, SpongeBob &amp; Patrick spit spitballs at him]
Squidward: Ow! What the heck was that?
SpongeBob: Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
Squidward: Ceremony for what?
SpongeBob: We're going to put you to rest.
Squidward: I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, really? I'm going to go check. [walks off. Opens door and screams because he sees Patrick &amp; SpongeBob with a coffin]
SpongeBob: Okay, get in.
Squidward: Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing!
SpongeBob: But you said we could put you to rest.
Squidward: I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick outside ]
Squidward: Now what? [Squidward sees SpongeBob writing on a tombstone]
SpongeBob: I wrote "Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but he..." [Squidward screams] Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?
Squidward: SpongeBob! Cut that out!
SpongeBob: Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. [a bus with a load of people are in front of Squidward's house]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
SpongeBob: No, just into this hole.
Squidward: [Groans then sighs] SpongeBob, I have a confession to make. [Takes off his night cap]
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're bald?
Squidward&#160;: No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!
SpongeBob: But-
Squidward: Do it!
SpongeBob: Go home. [People get back on bus sadly] But I, Master--
Squidward: I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and stop doing me favors! [walks off]
SpongeBob: As you wish, master.
Squidward: D'oh!
Patrick: Boy, he really had us fooled.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.
Patrick: You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
SpongeBob: Patrick, say that again.
Patrick: That again?
SpongeBob: No, the other thing.
Patrick: No, the other thing.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] No, what you said before when you...
Patrick: No, what you said before when you...
SpongeBob: Never mind! I've got an idea.
Patrick: Never mind! I've got an idea. [SpongeBob gets annoyed again. Later, Squidward is reclining on his chair outside. SpongeBob is trying to blow a bubble big enough to get Squidward]
SpongeBob: I can't reach him!
Patrick: Blow harder! [SpongeBob blows a big bubble to consume Squidward. The bubble lifts Squidward gently from his chair. The octopus doesn't notice that he's floating.] There he goes!
SpongeBob: Isn't he beautiful?
Patrick: How high's he going to go? [Squidward sees he's floating]
SpongeBob: All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond. [both of them wave to Squidward] Goodbye, friend!
Patrick: Happy trails! [Squidward pounds his fists on the bubble and tries to yell, but his voice is so distorted by the soapy wall that unintelligible muffled noises come through.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: He's on the other side now.
Patrick: Yeah. [Squidward is floating above the sea at Bikini Atoll island in a bubble] He's in a better place. [Squidward moans in the bubble with seagulls flying around him]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward.
Squidward: All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is?
Squidward: Annoy Squidward Day?
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, silly! [gets out a calendar] That's on the 15th! [day is marked by a picture of Squidward's head] Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
Squidward: SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money.
SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.
Squidward: Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame? [shows wall full of SpongeBob pictures for being Employee of the Month]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.
Mr. Krabs: Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner! [whispering] Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout. [shows Squidward reading a magazine] There might be a new face on the wall this month.
SpongeBob: Huh? [looks over and sees the month of "January" with no picture]
Squidward: That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you. [Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh at SpongeBob as he walks over to the wall and imagines Squidward laughing at him in the picture]
SpongeBob: Nooo! [begins to sob] How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?! [Squidward's picture continues to laugh. Scene goes to SpongeBob grilling and flipping patties until he comes to a patty that won't flip. He tries and tries, but then he flips the patty on to the ceiling. He then tries to get it off of there.]
Squidward: [peeks in] Need some help? [SpongeBob screams] What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Making...Krabby Patties?
Squidward: You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of-- [SpongeBob gets the patty off the ceiling, but he flings it into the fan and it sprays Squidward with all the meat] ...garbage.
SpongeBob: [jumps off of ceiling] Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
Squidward: I already told you, that award is a bunch of... [gets sprayed with meat again] ...baloney!
SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
Squidward: [grabs SpongeBob's hat] It's a symbol that you're a chump! [SpongeBob screams, feeling scared]
SpongeBob: No, Squidward! [screams]
Squidward: And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award! [Squidward lifts his foot and tries to stomp the hat flat, but his foot hits something that is under the hat, and he screams in pain. SpongeBob lifts up the hat to reveal a stick of lead underneath]
SpongeBob: An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
Squidward: I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke! [Squidward walks away, but is sprayed with meat for the last time. Then we see SpongeBob looking at all his award photos]
SpongeBob: What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?! [every award photo now has an army hat on]
SpongeBob Picture: Stow that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!
SpongeBob: But, sir…
SpongeBob Picture: There's no room for "buts" in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?
SpongeBob: Crystal, sir!
SpongeBob Picture: Good! Now move out! [SpongeBob marches away and then we see SpongeBob looking through his windows through binoculars while Squidward gets ready for bed]
SpongeBob: I won't let Squidward win! [Squidward sets his alarm and walks off] He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited. [SpongeBob sneaks up to Squidward's house by sliding on the ground then through one of Squidward's windows and as he enters he falls to the ground and Squidward's hears the noise while he is brushing his teeth. Squidward goes to check what it is and SpongeBob is standing behind the plant by the door. Squidward closes the door and SpongeBob slides around the door and then by Squidward's bed where the alarm clock is. He is about to grab it when he hears the door handle jiggle so he hides in the pillow on the bed. Squidward gets into bed and isn't comfortable with the pillow as it is so he adjusts it. Tries to adjust it again and you can hear SpongeBob's giggling. Squidward lays his head down and SpongeBob's hand reaches out for the clock and Squidward sees it. Squidward freaks out and throws the pillow against the wall. The cover comes down, revealing SpongeBob]
Squidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here? [SpongeBob grabs alarm clock]
SpongeBob: You can't win that award if you don't get up for work! [SpongeBob destroys the clock. Squidward grabs another one and sets it on the stand. SpongeBob grabs that one and destroys it. Squidward opens up a closet full of alarm clocks. SpongeBob grabs a few clocks and destroys them one by one]
Squidward: Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!
SpongeBob: [tosses the destroyed alarm clock over his shoulder] That can be arranged.
Squidward: You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.
Squidward: Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!
SpongeBob: I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
Squidward: Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!
SpongeBob: Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!
Squidward: Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!
SpongeBob: Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!
Squidward: I don't need to sleep! Loser!
SpongeBob: Well, me neither! …26-time loser! [SpongeBob and Squidward are watching each other through their windows] Look at him. Watchin' me.
Squidward: I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?
Squidward: No, how about you?
SpongeBob: Nope! [Squidward gets out his clarinet and plays "Brahms' Lullaby". SpongeBob struggles to keep himself awake.] Nighty Night. [SpongeBob falls asleep and starts to snore. Later, Squidward tries to walk out, but falls into a very deep square hole right in front of his door]
Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes up with a shovel in his hand]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?
Squidward: I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here! Now get me outta here!
SpongeBob: All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [Squidward screams some more. SpongeBob walks back to bed] 
SpongeBob: Now to get some rest. Don't wanna look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo! [SpongeBob goes to his bed and sleeps a while. Squidward manages to climb out of the hole; SpongeBob wakes up to hear some hammering] Squidward! [Squidward is nailing boards onto SpongeBob's front door] 
Squidward: That oughta hold him! [SpongeBob saws around it and pushes the door on Squidward and runs away. A cage drops enclosing SpongeBob and Squidward laughs. SpongeBob slides out because he can fit through the bars]
Squidward: [walks along into a bottle and gets trapped] SpongeBob! Why, you little…! [SpongeBob writes "loser." on the bottle with his finger in a script writing and runs away. Later he sees a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty! [smells it but the top bun opens up and a claw comes out grabbing SpongeBob's nose] Ow! Squidward!
Squidward: So long, Sponge loser! [Squidward gets caught in a net and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob runs through a barbed-wire fence and Squidward runs by laughing. Squidward is tied by his tentacles and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob is stuck in a brick wall and Squidward runs by laughing. Later the two are trying to drag along some big items. SpongeBob is dragging an anchor and Squidward is dragging a flaming boat] SpongeBob? Truce? [both wave a white flag]
SpongeBob: Truce.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!
SpongeBob: You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it. [it’s now dawn]
Squidward: Okay, let's have a good clean fight.
SpongeBob: And may the better man win. [shakes hands with Squidward, now he's thinking] He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
Squidward: [thinking] Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.
SpongeBob: [thinking] As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
Squidward: [thinking] ...I'm gonna make a run for it.
[SpongeBob and Squidward stop shaking hands, laugh nervously, and hastily run for the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is opening it up]
Mr. Krabs: Money, money, gonna make some money! [sees SpongeBob and Squidward come running over] Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early! [Mr. Krabs realizes that they aren't stopping for anything] Wait! [both push Mr. Krabs out of the way and start doing nice stuff]
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!
Squidward: Clean tables, Mr. Krabs! [Squidward presses too hard on the table while he is cleaning and breaks it in half]
SpongeBob: Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here?! [SpongeBob drops and breaks the dishes and mops them just like that]
SpongeBob: It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: No!
Squidward: Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob puts his money into the register. Squidward and SpongeBob are in the kitchen] Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!
Squidward: There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double your output, SpongeHog!
Mr. Krabs: Boys, boys, boys! [music gradually speeds up; both SpongeBob and Squidward make many patties to overflow the kitchen, cornering Mr. Krabs] Help! Help! [the amount of Krabby Patties fills up the kitchen and the Krusty Krab itself, causing the whole restaurant to explode, sending thousands of patties raining down in front of the citizens]
Frank: Hey, free Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: [with his head bursting through one of SpongeBob's employee pictures] Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait! Wait! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! [SpongeBob and Squidward come through the picture frame that Mr. Krabs is in and ask him who is the winner, while Mr. Krabs is still complaining about the Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?
Squidward: Me, me! It's me! [SpongeBob and Squidward continue calling out simultaneously about who is the winner]
Mr. Krabs: Boys! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!
Narrator: Halloween is no different under the waves. Pirates, skeletons, and sea monsters. [laughs evilly] Ohh, sorry. Everyone having fun. Well, almost everyone. [SpongeBob is washing the dishes in the Krusty Krab kitchen. The door creaks open, and SpongeBob jumps in surprise]
SpongeBob: Huh? Who's there? [door creaks open some more as SpongeBob goes back to washing some dishes. Turns around and three pieces of paper spelling out "boo" turn on the ordering turntable. SpongeBob speeds up the cleaning of the dishes until he finishes]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving! [tries running out, but Mr. Krabs stops him in his tracks]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on. Don't you want to hear my annual scary story?
SpongeBob: No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, the worst monster of them all.
SpongeBob: Uhh... no. [opens the door then turns around] Is it a true story?
Mr. Krabs: True as the deep blue.
SpongeBob: Okay, maybe just a little.
Mr. Krabs: Have a seat, me boy. [runs while saying "hot, hot, hot when carrying the campfire" sits on a log. Mr. Krabs puts a campfire in the middle of them] Every year on Halloween night, the Flying Dutchman descends on Bikini Bottom, in a pirate ship, just like this. [holds up a Krabby Patty] Only bigger!
SpongeBob: Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: Like I was saying, the Flying Dutchman swoops down and starts stealing people's souls. [holds up a pickle]
SpongeBob: Do souls look like pickles?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, as a matter of fact, they do. And he puts them where you can never get them... in his soul bag. [drops the pickle into a bag that has the words "Krusty Krab" crossed out and the word "soul" written above it. Mr. Krabs laughs evilly as Squidward appears behind SpongeBob in a pirate suit]
Squidward: I've come for your pickle. [SpongeBob jumps up screaming]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, Scaredy Pants gets easier to scare every year! [Squidward takes his costume off as SpongeBob, in a barrel, sees the pirate was Squidward]
SpongeBob: Humph, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs: Nothing like a good ghost story, eh, me boy? Hope you're not too scared to come to me party tonight, SpongeBob ScaredyPants! [laughs while walking out]
Squidward: [walks up behind SpongeBob] Steal your soul. [SpongeBob jumps out of the Krusty Krab screaming and beings to walk home. As he is walking home, he sees a jack-o-lantern and then he walks up to a kid in a cowboy costume]
Kid: Twick-ow-tweat! [SpongeBob screams and runs away. The kid’s parents walk up next to their son]
Mother: It's okay, son. That's just SpongeBob ScaredyPants. [SpongeBob is walking home until Mrs. Puff drives up and honks the horn, sending SpongeBob screaming and jumping to hold onto the street light]
Mrs. Puff: Happy Halloween, ScaredyPants. [drives off laughing]
SpongeBob: The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants! [Cut later at his house, inside a pumpkin. SpongeBob and Gary are inside of it] I don't get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [carves his pumpkin from the inside] Well, I'm sick of it. [SpongeBob comes out] No more ScaredyPants! [notices his pumpkin and screams while running into his closet]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Gary, it's Patrick! I'm going to scare him! It's my turn. [opens the door and tries to scare Patrick] Rawr! [Patrick has some funny glasses on]
Patrick: Hiya, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams. Patrick takes his glasses off] Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
SpongeBob: Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance?
Patrick: Well, if you want to be scary, you got to need a good costume. [later, SpongeBob walks out of his closet with a big, white sheet on]
SpongeBob: What do you think?
Patrick: Great! You're going as my trick-or-treat bag!
SpongeBob: No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Uhh... something's missing. I know! [Patrick runs inside SpongeBob's closet. A tree falls down but then gets sawed down by Patrick. Patrick comes out with a pair of clogs] Step into these babies, Hans. [SpongeBob steps into the clogs] Terrifying.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. [doorbell rings]
Patrick: Come on, SpongeBob. It's little kids! Little kids are easy to scare! [door opens]
Kids: Trick-or-treat!
SpongeBob: [jumps out and tries to scare the kids like he did Patrick] Rawr-rawr! [kids laugh]
Kid #1: Look, it's the haunted mattress!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, here's your candy.
Kid #1: No, please, that was enough of a treat, thank you. [kids walk away laughing]
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick.
Patrick: SpongeBob, look at my new paper ghost! [Patrick holds scissors in his right hand a has a puppet on his left hand] Oooh, scary.
SpongeBob: That is it, Patrick!
Patrick: What's it?
SpongeBob: What's the difference between that ghost and me? [Patrick concentrates]
Patrick: No, no, no wait. Don't tell me. [concentrates more] D-don't tell me. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I can do this. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Okay, tell me.
SpongeBob: I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary! [SpongeBob is now sitting on a chair in his bathroom. Patrick has goggles on]
Patrick: Okay, are you ready?
SpongeBob: [shows paper ghost] Remember, like this. [Patrick razors off SpongeBob's sides]
Patrick: Are you sure you want to do this?
SpongeBob: Shave me down, make me round! [Patrick razors off more and uses one piece to wipe off his sweat from his forehead]
Patrick: All right, let's get to it. [razors off more part. Later, SpongeBob is a round ghost]
SpongeBob: What do you think?
Patrick: Perfect. Now that's scary! [Patrick puts on his funny glasses] Let's go scare somebody. [SpongeBob runs down a street trying to scare people]
SpongeBob: Oooh... I'm the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Oooh... I don't know who I am! [man opens door]
SpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Oooh, I'm the Flying Dutchman's best friend! [both run off laughing]
Man: Hey, don't you kids want your candy? [both jump behind some coral in the shape of a skeleton head]
Patrick: Oh, boy, that was something. Your costume really packs a punch.
SpongeBob: Do you think?
Patrick: Oh, no question! You scared the barnacles off that guy!
SpongeBob: Who should we scare next?
Patrick: There's a whole party just full of people at the Krusty Krab and the Flying Dutchman is going to be show up uninvited! [kids laughing] Here comes someone now! [SpongeBob jumps out to scare the kids from earlier]
SpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman! [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick run off laughing again]
Kid #2: Wasn't that the Haunted Mattress?
Kid #3: I guess he's been demoted to a haunted sleeping bag! [kids laugh.]
[Later, Mr. Krabs is bobbing for apples with his daughter Pearl, who is dressed up as Frankenstein's bride. Mr. Krabs successfully bobs an apple, but accidentally swallows it. Mr. Krabs chokes on an apple]
Pearl: Oh, dad, you're embarrassing me again! [cries and runs off. Krabs spits out the apple which shoots past Squidward and Sandy]
Sandy: Howdy, Squidward, I mean, Flying Dutchman. Great party, huh?
Squidward: What are you supposed to be?
Sandy: Why, I'm a pet goldfish in a bowl!
Squidward: I don't get it. [SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is tied up with some rope which Patrick will lower him in with. SpongeBob opens a door on the roof to peek through to look at the party]
Patrick: Are you ready, SpongeBob? [thumbs up from SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, kill the lights!
[lights go off. As soon as this happens, everybody begins panicking and running around screaming. SpongeBob is lowered in appearing with a scary look. Patrick begins talking through a megaphone to scare everyone. Mr. Krabs even hides in the apple barrel]
Patrick: Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I am the Flying Dutchman! Booga, booga, booga, booga! Give me your souls!
[a jellyfish zaps Patrick. He screams and lets the rope go plunging SpongeBob down onto the floor]
Patrick: Huh? [screams]
Kid #3: [notices SpongeBob's pants] Hey, that's no Dutchman, that's SpongeBob!
Sandy: SpongeBob?
Squidward: SpongeBob. [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: [still dangling] Help! Help!
Patrick: [using megaphone] I am not SpongeBob. Those are my street clothes! [thunder appears and the front doors are open]
Flying Dutchman: Enough! [everyone gasps as green smoke comes into the Krusty Krab. A green figure appears]
Mr. Krabs: It's the real Flying Dutchman! [he faints]
Flying Dutchman: You bet your white lily livers I'm the Flying Dutchman. And I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. I'm going to steal your souls. [everyone screams] Quiet! [breathes out flames to burn them] You had it coming, you little crybabies. Every year, people dressing up like me. [Squidward takes his costume off and whistles nonchalantly] Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that's not the reason I'm taking your souls. [pointing at SpongeBob, who is hanging upside down] No, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I've seen, yours is the most insulting.
SpongeBob: Do you mean I'm not scary?
Flying Dutchman: You? Scary?! [cackles, then cuts the rope holding SpongeBob, and he falls to the floor] Let me tell you about scary, kid. There's all kinds of scary things in the world. Spiders are scary, uhh, I'm scary. You... you're not scary. Okay, let's get this over with. [flies back to the partygoers to steal their souls and evilly laughs in their faces which makes everyone scream in terror, one fish even shaking his head begging for mercy]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
Flying Dutchman: First, I gotta get rid of this stupid costume. [takes off SpongeBob's ghost costume... then flies out screaming in terror. SpongeBob is now shown as skinless with just a brain, eyes, and a mouth with the lower half of his body]
SpongeBob: Hey, what do you know? I scared him! [laughs. Everyone else, except Patrick and himself, runs out screaming] It worked, Patrick. I scared everybody!
Patrick: Yeah, I guess it was your pink hat.
SpongeBob: Pink hat? Oh, that's not a hat. That's my brain.
Patrick: Oh. [runs away screaming. fade to black]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, it grows back!
SpongeBob: [Gary is on his exercise wheel] Exercise time is over, Gary. [takes Gary off his wheel] We don't want you getting too thin. [holds up a green, squishy ball] Here, boy. Fetch! [throws it and Gary goes after it but at a slow pace. SpongeBob checks his watch and goes sits on a chair and takes out the newspaper to read. Morning arrives, the rooster crows and SpongeBob is asleep in the chair. Gary crawls up to SpongeBob and spits out the ball]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? [sees the ball on the ground]  Good job, Gary! [He jumps to Gary] I love you, Gary! [He starts scratching Gary and Gary purrs] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary! [Gary climbs up on SpongeBob, purring and tickling him] Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha! [Patrick comes through the door]
Patrick: SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
SpongeBob: For what?
Patrick: The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend! [shows his jellyfishing net off until he brakes something and blushes with embarrassment] So, you ready or what?
SpongeBob: That was this weekend? [He looks up at Gary who's still crawling all over him trying to tickle him] I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
[There's a knock on the door. Squidward is seen outside. The door opens, but the first thing Squidward sees is Gary on SpongeBob's head. He looks down at SpongeBob and reveals a pair of underwear.]
Squidward: Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
Squidward: What's a Gary?
SpongeBob: Not a Gary. Gary. He's my pet snail. [shows Gary to Squidward] Say hello! [Gary hisses at Squidward and drools]
Squidward: Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
SpongeBob: I love Gary!
Squidward: Well, I don't. Get somebody else. [walks off]
SpongeBob: I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. [Squidward stops]
Squidward: Go away? [walks in reverse back to SpongeBob's Pineapple] You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
SpongeBob: Actually, a three day weekend.
Squidward: As in, not here for three days?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
Patrick: Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
Squidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
SpongeBob: You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk.[SpongeBob explains the daily routine with Gary, but Squidward is busy thinking of how much fun he'll have with SpongeBob &amp; Patrick away]
Squidward: Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend.
SpongeBob: Let me show you how to feed him. [opens a cabinet with six barrels of Gary's food] The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
Squidward: Sure it's enough? [bus drives up to the pineapple with other jellyfishers inside]
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Patrick: The bus is here! The bus is here! [crashes through the wall and through the bus leaving his starfish shape through each hole] C'mon, SpongeBob!
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Squidward: [pushing SpongeBob out of the house] Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye bye.
SpongeBob: Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
Squidward: I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
SpongeBob: Gary.
Squidward: Right, yeah, right. [bus drives off] Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers! [laughs with joy] They're gone! [runs inside his Easter Island Head. Gary peeks his eyes out the window]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: [comes out with shorts on and his nose with sunscreen on it and a chair. Unfolds the chair and sits on it] This is going to be the best three days of my life. [sighs and lays back with a sun reflector in front of him] I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob. [The time card "3 Days Later" appears, and now Squidward is badly sunburned, The bus comes back as the group is chanting "jellyfishing"] Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me. [Squidward sees Gary through the window. Gary groans. Squidward's sunburn drains] [screams] The snail! I forgot the snail! [runs inside the pineapple where Gary is old and withered on the floor. Squidward frantically takes him inside to the kitchen] I've got to do something. [takes all the barrels of food and puts it in his bowl] Okay, okay, okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here. [Squidward frantically throws the food at Gary's trying to get him to eat it] [Gary lip syncing what Squidward's saying]: Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat! You've gotta finish this food!
SpongeBob: See you later, Patrick.
Squidward: Come on, eat! Eat! Eat! [SpongeBob gets his house key out. Squidward has to decide about the food] Ohh...
SpongeBob: [sticks the key in the hole and opens the door] Gary! I'm home!
Squidward: [greets SpongeBob with a head full of Gary's food that he ate] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Squidward! What are you doing here? [Squidward swallows all the food]
Squidward: Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
SpongeBob: What a great friend you are, Squidward.
Squidward: So, uhh, well, see you. Goodbye.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. [Gary crawls to SpongeBob, still old and wrinkly] I can always count on you. [Gary moans and SpongeBob screams] Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! [Squidward frowns ‘cause he can't leave. Later, the doctors snail-mobile is in front of the pineapple]
Purple Doctorfish: Yes, yes, it's just as I thought.
SpongeBob: What?
Purple Doctorfish: This is definitely a snail.
SpongeBob: I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?
Purple Doctorfish: Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go. [hands the shot to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Aren't you going to do it?
Purple Doctorfish: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish. [doctor leaves. Squidward runs after him]
Squidward: Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
Squidward: Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do... [Gary moans and coughs badly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: Okay, okay, I'll do it. [takes the shot]
SpongeBob: Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady. [Squidward tries to give Gary the shot but SpongeBob pulls him away] Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. [Squidward keeps trying but gets the same result every time]
Squidward: Will you hold him still? [snail plasma shot in SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
Squidward: Well, you made me do it!
SpongeBob: What's going to happen to me?
Squidward: Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
SpongeBob: I don't know, I feel kind of funny!
Squidward: I'm telling you, it's all in your head. [Gary crawls to his water bowl to get a drink. After drinking the water, he gargles, clears his throat, and meows normally again.]
Squidward: He just needed water?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you're better! [hugs him]
Squidward: Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
Squidward: Trust me, SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine. [closes door]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
Gary: [jumps up] Meow! [SpongeBob pours food into Gary's bowl, but decides to see what it tastes like. He likes it so he eats all of it. Then walks to Gary with the empty bowl]
SpongeBob: Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself. [burps] Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! [SpongeBob begins to walk out of the kitchen. His feet make loud pounding noises as they hit the floor, and he begins to go slower and slower. Soon Gary is going faster than he is.]
SpongeBob: Gary, you're getting a [voice slows, lowers] lot faster! [SpongeBob sluggishly walks into the bathroom, and Gary follows him. He looks in the mirror, and his voice echoes as he speaks.]
SpongeBob:  Look at me. Never better. [He yelps as dramatic music begins to play in the background. His head begins to throb, and his pores begin to grow and shrink, before returning to normal.] I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine! [What he doesn't realize is that the worst is yet to come. His eyes bug out of his head, causing him to yell. The camera rotates around so we can get a side view of SpongeBob. He blinks, and his eyes briefly pop back into his head and return to normal. But this relief only lasts for about half a second. Then, his eyes bulge out even farther than before, and it looks very unnatural. They bulge for a while, and then they begin to transform, taking the shape and form of snail's eyes, with stalks. The sight causes SpongeBob's jaw to drop, and he screams louder. SpongeBob stares in the bathroom mirror at his brand-new eyestalks, which now have skin and eyelids around them. He turns to Gary.]
SpongeBob:  Gary... I'm fine! [But SpongeBob is not fine. Gary watches in horror as his owner falls onto his hands and knees, straining in pain.]
SpongeBob:  [in so much pain that he is barely comprehensible] Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see. [grunts and strains as his hand and arm slowly retract into his sleeve, which then pops off and bounces away] That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway! [Then, SpongeBob's feet and legs retract into his pants.]
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes! [his body shortens up like a snail and he screams] I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee [he loses the ability to talk and completes his snail transformation] ow!
Squidward: [in his bed] I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary. [a knock is heard on the door and the doorbell rings] Who could that be? As if I didn't already know. [Squidward walks to the door and opens it] SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just fi-i-i... [SpongeBob is a fully breaded snail now]
SpongeBob: Meow!
Squidward: [screams]
SpongeBob: Meow! Meow. [Squidward touches SpongeBob's left eye and it curls up]
Squidward: [screams and runs back inside shutting the door]
Squidward: SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done? [picks up the snail plasma shot] It's all your fault. [throws it away] Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Meow! [Squidward screams and puts boards on his door. Turns around and SpongeBob is at his window] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams] Meow! [Squidward puts more boards on his window, but SpongeBob squeezes through the boards holes] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams and runs into his closet]
Squidward: None of this would be happening if I'd only fed that snail! [SpongeBob squeezes in from under the door, and meows. Squidward screams and runs through his door, SpongeBob meows, Squidward runs up and down his ceiling while SpongeBob keeps meowing at him. Outside, his house is bouncing from side to side until it flipped on its side completely. Everything is broken and torn inside. Squidward sits up, but is injected with the snail plasma through his nose]
Squidward: Uh-oh! [now SpongeBob, Squidward, and Gary are on a fence singing "Blow the Man Down"]

Squidward: [kisses his clarinet] I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music. [He gets ready to play his clarinet, and then SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off, sending Squidward's clarinet into his throat] Yow! [Struggles to dislodge the clarinet out of his throat.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing? [Squidward tries to yell, but his clarinet sounds every time he tries to talk] Great! We'll be right over! [Squidward pulls the clarinet out of his throat. Door knocks are heard]
Squidward: I wonder who that could be. [Squidward opens the door]
SpongeBob: Ready to go?
Squidward: No, I'm not "ready to go!" [slams the door]
Patrick: He doesn't wanna play with us.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just not ready. [Squidward tries to play his clarinet, but he hears another knock at the door] Ready now?
Squidward: No! [slams door. Then he goes back to try to play clarinet is interrupted once again by yet another knock at door. Squidward gets angry]
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No! [slams the door. The knock on the door is heard again] Huh? [opens door]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams the door. Another knock on the door and he opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] No! [SpongeBob and Patrick are gone and they approach Squidward from behind. SpongeBob taps his shoulder] What?!
SpongeBob: Ready yet?
Squidward: No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?!
SpongeBob: Sure we do.
Squidward: What? [stammers] D'oh...! [shuts the door and leaves his house, then realizes he's outside. He runs back to his door and knocks. SpongeBob opens it]
SpongeBob: Ready? [Squidward slaps his forehead, and then pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of his house]
Squidward: OUT! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed. [Squidward gets an idea]
Squidward: Hold on a second. I'll be right out. [closes the door. Squidward tiptoes out the other way of his house to the Krusty Krab, and enters] Hello...? [silence] Ahh, alone at last. [tries to play his clarinet, but SpongeBob and Patrick are heard outside]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward? [Squidward runs into the kitchen as SpongeBob and Patrick come in the Krusty Krab and search for Squidward] Squidward! [Squidward runs into the freezer] Squidward? Oh, Squidward! [Squidward peeks out as SpongeBob and Patrick look for him] Squidward!
SpongeBob: Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!
Squidward: A-ha! They're finally gone! [tries to open the freezer, but it's locked from the inside!] What the...? [tries to open it multiple times] Locked?! Oh no! Oh... well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time.
Narrator: 2,000 years later...
[the scene shows Squidward still inside the freezer, frozen; the hinges are rusty, and they fall off; the door falls with Squidward frozen behind it; SpongeTron flies past and then back to Squidward]
Sponge-Tron: Holy Krabby Patties! A frozen cephalopod! [Sponge-Tron grabs a chrome hammer; from the hammer comes a red laser, which melts the ice and hits Squidward's buttocks; Squidward screams]
Squidward: [trancelike] I'll be out of here in no time.
Sponge-Tron: Greetings, primitive.
Squidward: Sp...SpongeBob? Is that you?
Sponge-Tron: SpongeBob? No! [robot voice] I am Sponge-Tron. [normal voice] Welcome to the future!
Squidward: What?
Sponge-Tron: Welcome to the future!
Squidward: Uh, the future... [notices everything's chrome] Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome?
Sponge-Tron: Everything is chrome in the future!
Squidward: Wha...? [stammers and runs to look outside a window] Oh, my... [notices the chrome environment. The screen pans around the chrome environment.] Impossible! He's lying! [A flower pops up from underground, then a truck comes, a fish gets out of the truck, runs up to the flower, sprays it with chrome spray paint, then runs back in the truck and drives away. Squidward looks at the screen.] He's right!
SpongeTron: Of course I'm right, Squidward! Just ask my clones: Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z. [Squidward flinches as a trio of Sponge-Tron clones have suddenly appeared next to them]
Squidward: Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?
Sponge-Tron: Sure! All 486 of them! [Squidward does a few sit-ups while he talks as if he is trying to wake up]
Squidward: FUTURE?! '"FUTURE?! FUTURE?! FUT--- [SpongeTron drops a brick on Squidward's head, so Squidward can't finish] Thanks. NOW LISTEN! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something!
Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z: [pull out jellyfishing nets] Jellyfishing! [a two-headed Patrick appears out of nowhere]
Pat-Tron: Did somebody say, "jellyfishing"?
Sponge-Tron: Hi, Pat-Tron!
Squidward: J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go!
Sponge-Tron: Well, why didn't you just ask? The time machine is down the hall, to the left. [Squidward runs to the door, laughs and enters, but the sound of a can-opener being used is heard. Squidward steps out and is torn into pieces, now appearing like a spring-shaped patch of skin] Oops! Oh, yeah, that one's the can opener... but try the one on the right. [Squidward tries the door on the right and enters a room that has a slot-looking machine that says "past" and "future"]
Squidward: Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior... [notices time-travel handle] Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past! [Squidward turns the key and puts the lever on "past." Siren goes off as time machine disappears from where it used to be in the Krusty Krab. Sponge-Tron waves at Squidward. The door and the wall fly through a hyperspace-like warp, then the time machine appears in a primitive Bikini Bottom.]
Squidward: [looks out and sees an Ammonite swim by. Whales calls can be heard] Wow, primitive. Has sort of an old-world charm. [a snake-like creature swims by really close to Squidward's face] Whoa! I guess this is before manners were invented! Well, at least there's no sign of SpongeBrat. Maybe now I can finally be alone with my clarinet. [hears a noise, turns around, but some shadow quickly hides. He hears another noise and checks again, but a different shadow hides] Huh? [one of the shadow figures swing from tree to tree] Huh? What?! [a shadow figure hides behind a tree] Huh!? [the other shadow figure hides behind a ledge. Squidward keeps walking and then notices a Prehistoric Sponge on the ground] SpongeBob? [Primate Sponge screams] Stay back! [Primate Sponge touches Squidward's arm and then sniffs his finger from what he touched. Tries to give some to Squidward] Uh, no thanks. [Squidward feels someone breathing on him and he turns and notices a Prehistoric Starfish breathing on him. Prehistoric Starfish smiles and reveals nasty, rotten teeth] Uh, hi there. Well, I better be going now. [Prehistoric Sponge grabs Squidward's tentacle] Yes, that's my arm. [Prehistoric Sponge puts Squidward's arm on his head and Prehistoric Starfish licks his hand] Oh, that's sweet. [Prehistoric Starfish gets scared; he smashes on the ground and gets the shivers] What, is it time for your flea bath now? [a jellyfish swims by and Prehistoric Starfish ducks for protection] Oh, look, it's just a little jellyfish. [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish run around screaming] Well, I'm going away now. [Squidward walks away] Ah, here's a nice, shady spot, away from those fools!
[Squidward plays his clarinet and each time he tries to play, Primate Sponge or Prehistoric Starfish holler, who are each giving a turn at holding the jellyfish]
Squidward: What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are confused] Give me those loincloths! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish tear off a piece of their loincloth] I can't believe it. [mumbles to self. Crafts the loincloth jellyfishing nets. Shows them the nets.] This oughta make things go a little smoother! [gives Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish their nets. They put the nets on their lips. Squidward facepalms and grabs the nets back] Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this! [Squidward catches the jellyfish in one of the loincloth nets] It's called jellyfishing. [Primate SpongeBob and Prehistoric Starfish grab the nets and chase the jellyfish] Ah, finally. [sits on the ground and plays his clarinet. Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish hear it, go berserk and chase Squidward. Squidward runs into the time machine as Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish try to get in by climbing on top of it; Squidward screams] Get me outta here! [moves the lever up and down really fast and breaks it] Uh-oh. [the word FUTURE spins like a slot machine, and stops on 2 lemons and a "BAR"]
Time Machine: Loser! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are banging on the time machine trying to get to Squidward until it disappears into thin-air. The time machine shakes from the inside, with Squidward scared. The camera zooms in, with a "paint" effect, then camera is on Squidward's face, and a color change effect goes off. The screen flashes white, and the machine goes through all sorts of dimensions, with one with a computer-like area, then the screen does a color change effect again, with the time machine folding like paper, and it vanishes with a zap sound.]
[Squidward appears in a blank, white space. He walks around, and hears a strange voice. He then notices some colored tiles and lifts one up and it floats and vanishes]
Squidward: He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all... [Squidward becomes tiny] ...alone! [a bunch of "alone" sayings appear with a different voice as each comes up]
Voices: Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! [Continuous "Alone" chanting is heard, as the screen continuously gets smaller and smaller]
Squidward: I gotta get outta of here! [Squidward tries to run, but he runs off and on the scene. He stops and tries to catch his breath. A strange voice is heard again, he holds his head, sweats a little, and runs again off and on the scene. He stops running after three tries to get out, yet another strange voice is heard when he stops] Where's the time machine?! Where's anything?! Where, where, where, where?! [jumps up and down angrily and busts a hole through the ground into the time machine. The handle is still broken off. Squidward bangs on the broken controls and sobs] I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob! [right when Squidward says "SpongeBob," the time machine disappears and reappears in present time Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob and Patrick are still waiting for Squidward in front of his house] SpongeBob! Patrick!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys.
SpongeBob: Does this mean you wanna go...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Jellyfishing?
Squidward: No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?
SpongeBob and Patrick: You are, Squidward! [They laugh as the scene cuts to the little island on the surface]
Squidward: I'm going back.
SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. [takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. [pulls socks off Gary's eyes] You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. [snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his shoes and then his mouth on a rock] Hey! Over here! [laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob's arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock, his pants start appearing, and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob's nose grows out] Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! [driver's license appears] Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! [Car starts to move crazily] I sure take a good picture. [drives through a sign that says "Road Ends"] Darn! I should have grown a mustache. [the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license] How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. [flies over the Krusty Krab] Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. [Mrs. Puff floats up to him] Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff: [takes his license and tears it up] Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob: No! [flies through the dream cloud and on SpongeBob's real bed] Ouch! Where am I? [walks and looks up to his real self] Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary: Meow. [snoring] Meow.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Gary's dream cloud] This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. [jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library] Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. [walks past a pile of books] Gary! Huh? [sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him] Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? [Gary turns around]
Gary: [gasps] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gary?
Gary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!
Gary: [sighs] In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Gary: Come. [they walk down an aisle of books] For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. [picks up a book and reads from it] "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob: Who?
Gary: [flips a few pages] Here's one you might know. [clears throat] There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. [starts walking away]
Gary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob: [jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window] I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. [Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over] I can't resist! [laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery] Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [walks over] You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. [transforms into the shape of a skyscraper] Going up! Eh? [sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again] I can make... [changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself] A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Patrick: Yup. [the clones disappear] 
SpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. [leaves]
Patrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob. [kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away] Oh! [the quarter falls into a grate] Shoot, that was my last quarter. [sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good! [inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head] Psst! Squidward! [waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing] Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: Ahem! [sitting in the balcony above the stage] Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward: Yes, Your Highness. [Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up] SpongeBob!
King: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! [giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow] Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward: [growling, pressing down on his clarinet] Sponge- [accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps] Bob...
King: [angry] I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Squidward: [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: [as a clarinet] Squidward! [points to himself and winks] Huh? Huh?
Squidward: [throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned] No way.
King: Ahem! [glares down at Squidward]
Squidward: [sighs and picks SpongeBob up] Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward. [Squidward blows into him]
SpongeBob: [off-key] La la! La la la la la la la! [The audience gasps again]
Squidward: [stops playing] SpongeBob!
King: [crying] Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
[Squidward smiles and SpongeBob winks at him]
SpongeBob: [continues singing off-key]
Fish: [crying] His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
[crowd cheers]
Squidward: [bowing] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob]
Fish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob: [turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess] So long, Squidward! [Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows, too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.]
Squidward: [starts tossing and turning in his bed, mumbling in angered pain]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome] Hey! I'm at Sandy's! [Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door] Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... [falls out of the plane and screams]
Sandy: [surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy: [turns upside down] Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. [a target is shown on the ground and SpongeBob and Sandy spins around]
SpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob: Okay! [gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate]
Sandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! [turns upside-down again]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger]
Sandy: Not a parakeet! Para- [Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time] medic...
SpongeBob: [screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground] Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. [sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house] H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. [climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations,other girly features and boyfriend portraits.] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Pearl: Hello, SpongeBob! [sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup]
SpongeBob: [waves] Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl: You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl: [Frowns] Oh. He's next door. [Rolls eyes, then shakes head in disappointment] Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob: Bye! [gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen] I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. [peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs’ boat]
Krabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon! [inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod] You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. [SpongeBob hops into the boat]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Krabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. [Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook] It's the mighty Moby Dollar! [Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.] Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes! [Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies] There she blows!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Krabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob: [grabs a small jellyfishing net] This one?
Krabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob: [reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it] Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Krabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob: [opens up the wallet] Net ready, sir!
Krabs: [pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet] I did it! [gets excited] I finally did it!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. [puts down the wallet and wants to shake hands with Mr. Krabs, but when he tries the wallet bounces toward the back of the boat; the wallet bounces away]
Krabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Krabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! [SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat]
SpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!
Krabs: No! [dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean]
SpongeBob: This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: [ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun] You're fired! [Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: [screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.] Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: Zap! [zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out] I see you. [stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self] Zap! [shoots a green laser out of his eye]
Fred: My leg!
Plankton: I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob: Plankton! [tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle]
Plankton: I see you... [SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground] Zap! [zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic] Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. [stomps on it] Crush! [picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off] Lick, lick!
SpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary: Meow! Meow!
SpongeBob: [Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.] Gary! Gary! No!
Gary: Meow! [Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds]
Plankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob: Gary! [jumps over to Gary and hugs him] I've got you, Gary!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! [steps on SpongeBob and Gary] Yeah! Huh? [lifts his foot from pain] Yow!
SpongeBob: [looking like a thumbtack] I think he's got the point. [laughs]
Plankton: [Starts shrinking.] Waaaaaah! [as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal, puny size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad] Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? [Burned Fred lifts his foot to step on him] No! No! No! Not the face! [gets squished. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall to the ground]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping] Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. [goes to sleep] Ah... [wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head]
Squidward: [Head of Squidward starts surrounding SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [The heads of Mr Krabs, Sandy, Gary, Plankton, Pearl and Patrick start surrounding SpongeBob]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
Krabs: SpongeBob!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
Plankton: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tossing and turning in his sleep] What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! [Squidward taps him and he wakes up.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams, then sees his friends stand around his bed, except Patrick] Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
All except Patrick: [grumble in agreement]
Plankton: Take a hike!
Squidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary: [In anger] Meow!
Patrick: [walks in] Does anyone have a quarter? [all stare at Patrick]
SpongeBob: [He is asleep in bed and dreaming that he is standing on a giant Krabby Patty, then black storm clouds roll in and it starts to rain Krabby Patties. One falls into his hands] Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah! [runs around eating patties. Dream ends. SpongeBob wakes up to see himself chewing on his pillow. He spits it out and his stomach growls] A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed. [kicks the pillow on the ground and jumps on it. Sees Gary meowing in his sleep] Aww, sleep tight, my little angel. [tip-toes past Gary. He tries to get down the stairs without waking up Gary but goes down really fast making a xylophone sound. He walks to the fridge] Ah, here it is. [grabs a jar of seanut butter out of the fridge and walks to the counter where there is food and utensils lying on it] Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to help you get to sleep. [as soon as SpongeBob takes a bite of the sandwich, he falls asleep. Behind him, the fridge is open and cold air comes out of it. In the morning, his whole house is frozen. The foghorn alarm clock breaks the ice. SpongeBob wakes up also shivering.] The fridge! [slides over and closes the fridge door, then sits down trying to get warm. He tries to stand up, but he slips and slides everywhere inside the house, and he breaks all the windows before stopping on his bed. He pulls the frozen covers over him, but the blanket breaks into pieces]
Gary: [wearing a hat and ear muffs] Meow.
SpongeBob: [slides into the bathroom] Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me. [He sneezes. Pink bubbles come out of him]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I can't get the suds, [sniffles] because then I'll have to miss work! [puts his underwear over his mouth and nose then sneezes. Pink bubbles come out again]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this. [turns around and has two bubbles representing his butt cheeks. Each one pops]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm not sick. I'm going to work. [at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is cooking when he sneezes loudly and he pulls entire hat over his head to muffle it. Mr. Krabs comes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's holding up those patties? [SpongeBob turns around looking pale]
SpongeBob: [weakly, visibly shaking] Right away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's wrong with you? You're paler than a baby sea horse. [Gary pops out of nowhere]
Gary: Meow. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: The suds?
SpongeBob: [holds up the Krabby Patty on a plate] Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir. [sneezes loudly, causing the patty to splatter all over Mr. Krabs' face]
Mr. Krabs: [wipes the patty off his face] Alright, SpongeBob, you're too sick to work.
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest. [Mr. Krabs opens the front door]
Mr. Krabs: No, now go home and get some rest. [SpongeBob walks off] Nothing personal, lad. I just can't have you sneezing all over my food! [customers overhear what Mr. Krabs just said and all spit out their food and panic]
Fred: My leg!
Mr. Krabs:  No, wait! Wait! [All the customers scramble out of the Krusty Krab. Back at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob is in his chair.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I feel horrible. [sneezes. Gary hides in his shell with pink bubbles all over his shell. Gary has an angry expression when he shows his eyes] Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it. [after he sneezes again, his right eye rolls down his face] I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand. [picks up the phone and dials Sandy's number]
Sandy: [running on her exercise wheel] Hello?
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm sick. [puts his eye back into place] Can you escort me to the doctor's?
Sandy: Oh, sure, SpongeBob. I'll be there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August in...
SpongeBob: Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks. [sneezes pink bubbles through Sandy's phone. Later, as SpongeBob is getting dressed for the doctor, the doorbell rings] Coming. [opens the door]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?
SpongeBob: I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.
Patrick: What? Oh, you can't go!
SpongeBob: Why not, Patrick?
Patrick: I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor's office is a horrible, horrible place!
SpongeBob: [sits in his chair] It can't be as horrible as the suds. [sneezes]
Patrick: Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well, first, they make you sit in the waiting room.
SpongeBob: Is that the horrible part, Patrick? [Gary appears beside the chair]
Patrick: No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines! [SpongeBob gasps. Patrick takes a piece of coral for a stethoscope] Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope.
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: Yes! It's a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it... [takes the end of the piece of coral and puts it on SpongeBob's chest] Ssssss! [SpongeBob jumps and runs around]
SpongeBob: No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No! [flips over on the floor] Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.
Patrick: Exactly. [SpongeBob sneezes. A pink bubble is in the place where Patrick's nose should be, then it pops]
SpongeBob: You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?
Patrick: What else are friends for? [later, SpongeBob is sitting on the table in his kitchen. Patrick is standing behind him. SpongeBob sneezes] It appears as though we'll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick. [pushes a small cork in one of SpongeBob's holes. Then plugs up the rest of the holes with more corks] Voilà! [SpongeBob sneezes, but no bubble come out] Feel better?
SpongeBob: I don't know. [he sneezes more and more, which after every sneeze he enlarges himself]
Patrick: Help, I'm shrinking! [SpongeBob breaks the table] No! Please don't hurt me!
SpongeBob: No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!
Patrick: You think so?
SpongeBob: Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!
Patrick: And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.
SpongeBob: [tries to press one button, but it pressed all because his fingers are too large] My fingers are too big for the buttons. [off-hook tone plays] Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me? [gives Patrick the phone]
Patrick: Sure, patient SpongeBob. [Patrick calls Sandy, who is about to head out for SpongeBob's place] Hello, Sandy?
Sandy: Hiya, Patrick.
Patrick: I'm calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob.
Sandy: I'm on my way over to take him to the hospital.
Patrick: Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today.
Sandy: Well, I'm coming over to take a look. I'll be over there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot...
Patrick: Oh, yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don't bother, Sandy! [hangs up] Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy's coming! Ah! We've got to make sure you're well, or she'll take you to the doctor! [runs into the kitchen with rubber gloves on and dips them into the sink of water] Don't touch me, I'm sterile! Scalpel, please. [takes some sea-nut butter and spreads it on SpongeBob's right foot. Then puts a piece of bread on each side and his shoe on it] Feeling better?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. [later, a string is attached to a door that Patrick closes. A tooth shoots out from the side]
Patrick: Feeling better yet?
SpongeBob: [missing a tooth] Not really.
Patrick: [jumping on SpongeBob in a ballet outfit] How...about...now?
SpongeBob: I don't...think so. [Patrick puts a big band-aid on SpongeBob's back]
Patrick: Feeling better?
SpongeBob: No. [Patrick rips the band-aid off while SpongeBob screams and puts it somewhere else on SpongeBob's back]
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Nope. [Patrick rips the band-aid off as SpongeBob screams again and puts it somewhere else on SpongeBob's back]
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. [Patrick rips the band-aid off as SpongeBob screams. Later, Sandy arrives outside SpongeBob's house]
Sandy: Hello, SpongeBob?
Patrick: [wears a black mask on his head] Uh-oh, it's Sandy. [SpongeBob is tied onto a medieval machine. He sneezes and enlarges himself into a ball. Sandy knocks on the door] There's no one home.
Sandy: Patrick, you open this door. [Patrick is rolling SpongeBob away] Patrick, sometimes I just don't understand you. [SpongeBob sneezes] Hey! [walks over to Patrick's house] Okay, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?
Patrick: Uhh, uhh, he's not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.
Sandy: Okay, now tell me, [shows two rocks] since when do you have two houses?
Patrick: Since I ran out of space to put my stuff.
Sandy: Uh-huh. Yeah. Since when does your house have feet? [SpongeBob's feet are sticking out of the other rock]
Patrick: This is my mobile home. [SpongeBob sneezes the rock off]
SpongeBob: Hiya, Sandy.
Patrick: [holding SpongeBob's hand] Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine.
Sandy: Patrick, SpongeBob has to see a real doctor.
Patrick: No, he doesn't! I'm taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'.
SpongeBob: Ahh... [a green substance-like gas spreads outs all over killing the plants, clams, and everything in its path]
Sandy: See? He's even worse than I thought.
Patrick: [wearing a clothespin on his nose] What do you mean? He's fine. [Sandy takes the clothespin off of his nose]
SpongeBob: I'm okay, Sandy, really. [sneezes again, enlarging himself more]
Sandy: I'm taking you to the doctor right now. [rolls SpongeBob away]
Patrick: Hey, that's my patient! [runs over and pushes SpongeBob the opposite way] You can't take him to the doctor's.
Sandy: [rolling SpongeBob the other way again] Don't be silly, Patrick!
Patrick: [carrying SpongeBob the other way] He's mine! [Sandy is log rolling SpongeBob the opposite way]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you'll be better soon. [Patrick is using a wheelbarrow for SpongeBob]
Patrick: I'll save you! [Sandy is using SpongeBob as a basketball]
SpongeBob: I'm better, guys! Really! [both push SpongeBob until he squeezes through them into the air]
Sandy: Now look what you've done, Patrick!
Patrick: What I've done? Everything was fine until you showed up.
Sandy: You should be arrested for impersonating a doctor!
Patrick: I am a good doctor, right, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob comes down and rolls away]
SpongeBob: Guys!
Sandy: Huh?
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I can't stop now! [screams while he rolls down a hill] Help me! [Mr. Krabs is cleaning some dimes]
Mr. Krabs: Shiny dimes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? [runs out the front doors] Stop! SpongeBob! Stop! [SpongeBob stops in front of restaurant. Mr. Krabs sighs in relief. Then SpongeBob screams as he sneezes so hard, the pink bubbles destroy the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is angry. Later at the hospital]
Purple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. SquarePants, it seems you have the suds. Are you ready for your treatment?
SpongeBob: [sniffles and shakes his head] You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?
Purple Doctorfish: No, silly, you get the sponge treatment. Oh, Hans? [a real hand comes through the door and takes SpongeBob out of the room. Shows the hand cleaning SpongeBob with soap]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! [Hans is using real SpongeBob to rub a man (played by Tom Kenny)'s back in the shower] This tickles! [Hans uses real SpongeBob to scrub a man's feet. SpongeBob sniffs] I can smell again! [real SpongeBob being used to wash a plate, a car and the floor] Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah! [SpongeBob being rinsed off in the sink and put back in the doctor's room. SpongeBob is a normal, yellow color] I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!
Hans: Here is your lollipop. [hands SpongeBob a big lollipop. Sandy winks at SpongeBob]
Patrick: A lollipop? [takes a bubble wand and blows a bubble] Hey, doc, well I’ve got the suds, too.
Purple Doctorfish: [sarcastically] Oh, yes, Dr. Patrick, we have a special treatment for you.
Patrick: [Patrick gets taken away by Hans. He's being washed in the sink with soap] Hey! Hey, wait! [used on a cactus] Ouch! That hurts! [being used to scrub a toilet] Wait, this doesn't seem right!
SpongeBob: [opens his house door with a bunch of hearts in his arms] Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom! 
Squidward: [walks out and sits on his lawn chair] Ah, time to relax. [takes out some gum and puts it in his mouth. Throws the gum wrapper away in front of SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob's pineapple moves forward closer to the wrapper and he opens the door]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward!
Squidward: [spits out gum] Well, time to go. [folds up the lawn chair and walks to his front door, but SpongeBob stops him]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Now what?
SpongeBob: You dropped this little piece of paper.
Squidward: Yeah, so what?
SpongeBob: I just figured you probably want it back.
Squidward: What's the big deal? It's only garbage?
SpongeBob: Garbage?! But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of...
Squidward: ...garbage. [walks inside his house]
SpongeBob: So you don't want it?
Squidward: Right! [closes door]
SpongeBob: Does that mean I can have it?
Squidward: Yes, by all means, take it. [phone rings. Picks it up] Hello?
SpongeBob: You sure?
Squidward: Yes! For the final time, I don't want that paper. It's yours forever and ever! [hangs up and sighs. SpongeBob appears from under the table where the phone is. Squidward screams]
SpongeBob: So are you definitely, positively sure?
Squidward: Get out!
SpongeBob: But are you...
Squidward: GET OUT!!! [gets SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: Last chance to change your mind, Squidward.
Squidward: Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg, and plead, and cry, don't give that paper back to me...ever!
SpongeBob: So, I take that as a possible no? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? [Squidward closes the door] Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep. Ah, Mr. Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward.
Squidward: [walking up to his clarinet] SpongeBob... [SpongeBob is laughing outside. Squidward tries to play his clarinet, but Squidward gets annoyed by SpongeBob's laughter, so he peeks out the window] What in the world are you giggling about?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just... [giggles] ...it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper! [Squidward walks back and picks up his clarinet]
Squidward: How can anyone have fun with just a piece of paper? [Squidward plays his clarinet, but has to stop due to SpongeBob's laughter continuing] Ohh...what can he possibly be doing with that paper?! [peeks out his window again and SpongeBob is running around with the piece of paper high, above his head]
SpongeBob: La, la, la, la, la. Gary, watch this! [twists his lower part of his body around and puts the piece of paper in it so it hangs out. Turns his lower body around] Guess what I am.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also... [deep voice] Super Sponge, soaking up crime. See, here's my cape. [blows on the piece of paper to make it look like a cape in the wind]
Squidward: Super-moron's more like it.
SpongeBob: Now I'm... [jumps into the air out of his pants. He is now naked with a paper for a loincloth] SpongeBob JunglePants! [does Tarzan impression]
Squidward: Oh, boy.
[SpongeBob swings on a vine and lands on his pineapple house]
SpongeBob: Ugh. SpongeBob JunglePants summon animal friends. [he roars like a lion, makes bird calls, makes a raspberry, makes horn noises, dolphin noises and seal noises]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary. I'm not a jungle boy. I'm a box of army supplies, [jumps off his pineapple with his clothes back on] bringing relief to the hungry troops! [has the paper act as a parachute and floats down to the ground. We see Squidward watching from a safe distance] Landing just in time for the bullfight! [he waves the paper in front of Gary] Toro, toro, Gary! Toro, toro! Toro, Gary, toro... [pushes Gary across with his foot] Hey, ole! Now for some impressions. A guy with a mustache. [puts the piece of paper where a mustache would be] Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache. A pirate with an eye patch. [puts the paper over one eye] Arrgh, I'm a pirate. A regular guy with an eye patch. [puts the paper over one eye] Arrgh, I am not a pirate.
Squidward: Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper. [SpongeBob is rolling the piece of paper on the top of his head. Then he sucks in the paper through one of his holes. Blows it in and out of his holes] How did he do that?
SpongeBob: Look, Gary, oral-gami. [puts the paper in his mouth and sticks his tongue out with a bird shape for the paper]
Kids: Bird! Yay! [SpongeBob does it again and comes out as a snowflake] Snowflake, yay! [SpongeBob does it again and comes out as a doll] Paper dolls, yay!
Squidward: Hey, that little paper does seem like fun. [puts his hand over his mouth] What am I saying?! I am such an idiot. [laughs] SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun? [opens up a magazine and starts reading it] Now, reading 'Boring Science Digest,' that's fun. [laughs at what the magazine says inside] Erosion. [laughs] Mitosis. [SpongeBob laughs. Later, Squidward is bathing] See, I can have fun taking a bath. [the paper comes flying through the window as an airplane and flies around Squidward a couple times as SpongeBob makes airplane noises. The paper then pauses mid-flight to "shoot" a rubber duck in the tub as SpongeBob imitates a machine gun before it flies back out the window. The rubber duck sinks under the water. Later, Squidward is painting] Painting fruit, there's nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything. [SpongeBob is laughing outside. Squidward paints, but he paints himself with the piece of paper over his nose. When he notices this, he tears up his painting] I'll prove to him that paper is not fun! [runs outside and whistles while playing paddleball] I'm having fun, la-la-la...
SpongeBob: [bouncing the piece of paper off his nose like it was a paddleball] Isn't this great? La-la-la-la-la... [SpongeBob jumps up and down] La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob, top this one. [takes out a ventriloquist doll that looks exactly like him] Hey, Lil' Squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms?
Lil' Squidward: I don't know, but have you looked in the mirror lately?
Squidward: What? What did you...? [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try. [folds the paper in half] Have you heard any good jokes, Mr. Paper?
Paper: What happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?
SpongeBob: I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?
Paper: It was all washed up! [a bunch of people come up and laugh with SpongeBob then leave. Squidward runs off]
SpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Squidward: [riding a shell mobile] Haha, I'm having so much fun with my new shell-cart. Ah-haha. Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this? [SpongeBob comes down with the paper acting as a helicopter]
SpongeBob: Nope. [flies away while Squidward drives his shell-cart through the side of his house. Then he comes out with his clarinet]
Squidward: Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper! [plays 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' off-key. Little black musical note symbols fall out of the clarinet as he plays]
SpongeBob: [applauding] Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original.
Squidward: What? I didn't play any wrong notes. [plays the song off-key again. Little black musical note symbols also fall off as he plays]
SpongeBob: Yeah, see, you're playing it like this... [plays his piece of paper as the clarinet with the note symbols coming out] ...when ordinarily it goes like this... [plays the song on-key at B♭ Major] I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself. [Plays a jazzy song with higher notes. A music sheet appears as he plays. Music sheet disappears after finishing the song.] Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?
Squidward: [grabs the paper but SpongeBob holds onto it] Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it! [SpongeBob still holding on to it] Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go... [jumps up and down]
SpongeBob: I can't!
Squidward: What do you mean you can't? [SpongeBob moves Squidward's hand off the piece of paper]
SpongeBob: I can't! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever.
Squidward: I never said anything like that!
SpongeBob: Sure you did, Squidward, look. [folds the paper a few times to make it look like a flip-book to what Squidward said earlier in the day]
Squidward: [In the flip-book] Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me… ever!
SpongeBob: Wanna see it again?
Squidward: No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise. [walks off] Maybe I should get going.
Squidward: Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something. [looks around for something to trade] Yeah-yeah, something, something... [reaches in his pocket and takes out something] A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum. [chuckles] I'm going to make you an offer. [SpongeBob looks to see what he has]
SpongeBob: Wow, pocket lint! [shows the pocket lint and rubberband in Squidward's hand] You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm...
Squidward: Not the lint, the rubber band!
SpongeBob: The rubber band? Do I dare?
Squidward: Oh, dare, dare!
SpongeBob: [begins to reach for it] Okay... [stops] Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise.
Squidward: Listen, you! [puts his nose against SpongeBob's nose] You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal. [Later, Squidward is bringing a TV over to SpongeBob's side in a wheelbarrow] Gotta get that paper. [walks back to get more]
SpongeBob: Squidward? [keeps walking back and forth with more stuff]
Squidward: Trade... [walks back]
SpongeBob: Hey, listen... [Squidward brings his house over]
Squidward: Everything must go! Well, that's the last of it. [all of Squidward's possessions are beside SpongeBob] I've given you everything but the shirt off my back. [SpongeBob looks at the paper]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it's...(cries) it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise.
Squidward: (sadly) Okay, the shirt! [takes his shirt off] Take it! Take my shirt!
SpongeBob: Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade! [puts the shirt on] I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, ‘cause this is all I'll need?
Squidward: You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this! I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage. [puts the paper on his butt and waves it at SpongeBob] I got it! Haha and you can't have it. [runs around SpongeBob] I got it, you're a sucker. You're a sucker, sucker! [laughs] At last, what should we try first, Mr. Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose. [puts the paper on his nose] Look at me! I'm a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait... [puts the paper in his mouth and sticks his tongue out revealing a wadded up piece of paper that is wet] Tada!
Children: Boo!
Squidward: [Takes the piece of paper off his tongue and dries off it.] Okay, okay, uhh, helicopter! [puts the piece of paper on his fingers] Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm flying! Oh yeah, I'm flying! I'm flying! That's right, that's right, here we go now. [bends up and down trying to fly] I'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying... [sighs] ...flying. [SpongeBob is looking at himself in the mirror with Squidward's shirt on him while Gary is playing his clarinet] Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground! [throws it on the ground] A guy stomping on the piece of paper [stomps on the paper then picks it up] I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a...
Patrick: [walks up to Squidward chewing gum] ...a worthless piece of paper. [Patrick grabs the paper] Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed, Squidward. [blows a gum bubble then puts the gum on the piece of paper and throws it behind him in the garbage can] Nice shirt, SpongeBob. [laughs]
Squidward: [wind whistling] Does anybody have any sunscreen?
Mr. Krabs: [Looks around the Krusty Krab with a telescope] Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!
SpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, I saw it first! Hah! [Jumps onto table and sweats] Mine, mine! Huh?!
SpongeBob: Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Where are the doubloons?
SpongeBob: [laughs] There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt".
Patrick: Based on a real treasure map.
SpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.
Patrick: Yeah! C'mon, sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?
SpongeBob: I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
SpongeBob: [chewing gum] I already took care of it.
Mr. Krabs: Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
Patrick: My turn. [rolls dice] Five. [makes raspberry noise while moving piece. Reads card] One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm. [SpongeBob turns his eyes toward Mr. Krabs] It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick, you're fired!
Patrick: But I don't even work here!
Mr. Krabs: Would you like a job, starting now? [puts hat on Patrick's head]
Patrick: Boy, would I?!
Mr. Krabs: [takes hat off Patrick's head] You're fired!
SpongeBob: My turn. [rolls dice] One, two, three, four. [picks up card and reads it] Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. [looks through the hole in the tree] Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Shiver me timbers!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
SpongeBob: [picks up card and reads it] You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Treasure. [digs and mini plastic treasure chest appears] There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. [starts sweating profusely]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
Fred: [walks into The Krusty Krab] Rev up those fryers, ‘cause I am sure hungry for one-- [Mr. Krabs picks him up, holds him over his head, and heads for the door]  Help! Help! [Mr. Krabs throws him out the door] My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Can't you see we're closed?! [rushes back to the game table] Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Six! One, two... [scenery changes from day to night. SpongeBob and Patrick are tired; Patrick is even asleep on the table] I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
SpongeBob: I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [he yawns, slings Patrick over his shoulder, and carries him out] See you tomorrow. [walks inside house after taking Patrick home. Rattling noises heard] Huh? Who's there? [turns light on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
SpongeBob: [pushes Mr. Krabs outside] Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. [closes door but Mr. Krabs is inside the house once again]
Mr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta... [opens door, and Mr. Krabs is now outside]
Mr. Krabs: That's awful, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: I'll roll for you, boy.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: One, two, three...
SpongeBob: [yelling in fury] MR. KRABS!!! I WANNA GO TO BED!!!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
Mr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad. [SpongeBob shuts the door. Morning arrives] Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
SpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
SpongeBob: Pirates?
Mr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick appears from the side of SpongeBob's house] Treasure? [dancing around] We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip. [throws them a bag of pirate stuff] Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.
Mr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
SpongeBob: [Walks towards the plank using two peg legs] Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! [falls on plank]
Patrick: [Walks towards the plank with two separate eyepatches covering his eyes] I'm Blind Beard the Pirate. [falls on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! [sailing underwater] Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
SpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.
SpongeBob: Okie dokie, then.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then." A pirate says, "arrgh!"
SpongeBob: Okie... oops. [laughs while a jellyfish swims by him] I mean... [standing up] arrgh! Captain Krabs. [eyes widen] Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...
Mr. Krabs: Out with it man, arrgh!
Patrick: I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...! [crash] land...
Mr. Krabs: ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater captain.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has... [Mr. Krabs pulls a leaf off] Which way, captain?
Mr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?
Patrick: Uhh... let's see, uhh... [points] that way, captain!
Mr. Krabs: 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the "X"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.
Patrick: Ooh! East? I thought you said "weast"!
Mr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?
Patrick: This one, sir.
Mr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. [cuts to the crew walking again] 9,551... 9,552...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
Patrick: And hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew... [one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand! [cries]
Patrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
SpongeBob: [sniffles and crying] Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. [both cry]
Mr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
SpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one! [laying on ground at night outside tent]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
Patrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.
SpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours.
Patrick: I know. [laughs. SpongeBob moves away]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Captain Krabs?
SpongeBob: He's not here.
Patrick: Look! The treasure map.
SpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah...
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map. [Patrick touches the map]
Patrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?
SpongeBob: No, guess there isn't. [Both poking map. Map opens] Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself. [Both laugh. Eyes enlarge and search the map]
SpongeBob and Patrick: The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it. [Eyes freeze for a second and then pop back in their heads.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?
SpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
Mr. Krabs: [appearing right behind them] Do you think this is a problem?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?
Patrick: We're sorry.
Mr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
SpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
Patrick: I think that.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Look! It's the "X".
Mr. Krabs: [eyes go into "X" like symbol] "X" marks the spot!
SpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
SpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha. Hand it up to me, lads. Heave! [Brings treasure up]
Mr. Krabs: We finally found it. [opens up the treasure chest]
Female Singers: The Dutchman's Treasure.
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
SpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
SpongeBob: What about loyalty?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman. [wakes up] Who dares wake the Flying Dutchman? Keep it down will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all. [Lightning]
Flying Dutchman: Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure?
Mr. Krabs: [shoves chest toward SpongeBob and Patrick] They did!
Flying Dutchman: Arrgh! So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-huh!
Flying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.
SpongeBob: Wow!
Female Singers: Two Gold Doubloons.
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?
Flying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble. [Flicks something to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.
Female Singers: Plastic!
Flying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest. [laughs]
Patrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
[Flying Dutchman turns into green smoke and vanishes.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahhh, what a beautiful day! [SpongeBob's hand appears from a sand castle pineapple with his face drawn on his hand] I wonder if Patrick's at home.
Patrick: Hiya, SpongeBob! [Patrick's hand comes over from a sand castle rock with his face drawn on his hand] Whatcha doin'?
SpongeBob: Goin' over to Sandy's place. [both hands walk off together and arrive at a sand-made treedome] Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
Sandy: Don't lose your barnacles, boys. Hi-yah! [Chops sand castle peak down making a sand image of Texas] There it is!
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: Can't you see? It's Texas.
SpongeBob: Texas? What's a Texas? [a wave covers sand and ruins Sandy's Texas display]
Sandy: Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.
SpongeBob: All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.
Sandy: You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Sandy? Hi-yah!
Sandy: Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.
SpongeBob: Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy. [Turns around] Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! [grabs Don the Whale from behind and flips him over onto the ground. Don growls like a dog and punches SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy? [surfs in the air] Surf's up, Sandy!
Sandy: No, thanks. [enters Jellyfish Fields. Jellyfish are heard buzzing]
SpongeBob: [Runs after a jellyfish with a net] Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! [Patrick runs after one while laughing, then falls on his face. He gets up and runs again]
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy, we caught one!
Sandy: Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
Patrick: Fly away, little critter!
SpongeBob: Go on, go back to where you belong. [the jellyfish flies away as Sandy watches teary-eyed] Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home! [Sandy cries filling her helmet with tears. She takes a flusher handle and attaches it to her helmet, then she pulls it down and all the water drains out. Sandy gasps for air and pants] Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
Sandy: I ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!
SpongeBob: [suspicious] Sandy...
Sandy: [confessing] Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick.
SpongeBob: Homesick, huh? [SpongeBob thinks, and later, Sandy is blindfolded as SpongeBob and Patrick take her somewhere] Almost there.
Sandy: Heck gum it, SpongeBob, what is it?
SpongeBob: Da-ta-dah. [the three are standing outside the Treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Welcome home, Sandy!
[pause. Sandy cries and runs into the treedome]
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: Go away. [pulls a lever which brings down a metal covering on the treedome]
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?
Patrick: Maybe it's just a squirrel thing. [a hole opens up in the top of the dome and Sandy comes out wearing a cowgirl hat and holding a guitar. Sandy tunes it]
Sandy: ♪Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.♪ [live action Texas scenery appears behind her] ♪Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.♪ [some clams howl along. SpongeBob and Patrick hear the music]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, do you hear that? [Patrick has the notes going around him]
Patrick: Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy.
Sandy: ♪I wanna wake up in Texas.♪ [live action scenery is shown] ♪I miss those wide open skies. I miss my twenty acres, barbecues and pecan pies, oh, why? When I'm so far from you Texas, all I can do is cry.♪ [a live-action squirrel sheds a tear. SpongeBob and Patrick start sobbing. At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs hears the song, too, and starts sobbing also and accidentally gets hit by the cash register.]
Fish #1, #2, #3: Please Make It Stop! [Two customers are also sobbing; one dries his eyes with his Krabby Patty and gives it to the next person who blows his nose on it]
Sandy: ♪I wanna go hoooommme.♪ [Junior Brown's voice] ♪I wanna go home.♪ [as she sings she goes back into the Treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick continue sobbing and then stop]
Patrick: Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?
SpongeBob: Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas.
Patrick: Well, let's get some Texas and bring it down here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, we can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!
Patrick: [mishears, and frantically covers himself] Where?
[Later, SpongeBob and Patrick have gotten everything ready at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now.
Mr. Krabs: [from inside] Well, hurry up, lads! We can't squat like this forever!
[at Sandy's house where SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are playing leapfrog while going to her treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Sandy's surprise is at the Krusty Krab!
Patrick: Wait until she sees the...
SpongeBob: Shh! Don't spoil the surprise! [SpongeBob knocks, Sandy opens her door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, Sandy!
SpongeBob: You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [walks out with two suitcases] Hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob: What are you doing with those bags?
Sandy: I'm going back home to Texas.
SpongeBob: What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we...
Sandy: It's time for this tumbleweed to tumble on home.
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: I'm tired of fish food, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [gets on a bus] I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad.
SpongeBob: No, no! Wait! Sandy! [the bus drives off] I can't believe she's gone.
Patrick: Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas? [the bus suddenly speeds back; the doors open revealing a very angry Sandy]
Sandy: What did you say?
Patrick: Texas is dumb?
Sandy: [the bus drives off again] Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain!
SpongeBob: You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?
Sandy: No, you can't!
Patrick: Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?
Sandy: No! You can't say nothing about Texas!
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about... [turns around; grabs his behind and shakes it and rolls eyes] Texas!
Sandy: [blushes angrily] I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!
Patrick: I'm Texas, too! Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
SpongeBob: Howdy y'all!
Patrick: Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
Sandy: Y'all best cut it out!
SpongeBob: [while Patrick does armpit farts] The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas! [Sandy gets steaming mad. SpongeBob turns into the shape of Texas] Hey, Patrick, what am I now?
Patrick: Uhh, stupid?
SpongeBob: No, I'm Texas!
Patrick: What's the difference?! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Sandy: [drops suitcases] Y'all best apologize, or I'm gonna be on you like ugly on an ape!
SpongeBob: You'll have to catch us first! [SpongeBob and Patrick run off] We did it! We got her!
Patrick: Krusty Krab, here we come! [turns head around to Sandy] Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, that's enough.
Patrick: Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... [...catch up, which she is. And fast. Patrick's eyes bug out and he screams]
SpongeBob: Run faster, Patrick! [both of them scream; they go around each side of a huge rock. Sandy crashes right through the rock, obliterating it, and walks with a twirling rope. Her shoe engulfs the screen, Sandy ropes Patrick and brings him into the background]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob! [Nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears. SpongeBob screams. SpongeBob stops in front of a leaf and shakes as Sandy karate chops the leaf and SpongeBob in half]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob jumps with his halves and he gets back together] Y'all gonna take back what ya said!
SpongeBob: No! Almost there! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. Sandy's rope turns into the shape of SpongeBob; SpongeBob screams. As he jumps for the Krusty Krab, Sandy throws her rope. SpongeBob hangs onto the door as Sandy pulls him towards her]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you've been messing with the bull! Now here come the horns!
SpongeBob: Sandy, no! [the front of the Krusty Krab tears off as Sandy has pulled tight enough]
Everyone: Howdy, y'all!
Sandy: Wha-what's this?
SpongeBob: It's a party!
Patrick: [hops over with arms and legs tied and covered in bandages] For you!
Sandy: For me?!
SpongeBob: It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out, Sandy! We got square dancing... [Flats is holding a square] ...giant Barbecues... [Squidward is holding a sharp, spiky Q]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: ...homemade peas-in-a-can pie... [Pearl is holding a pie with a can of peas in it] ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats! [SpongeBob and Patrick put ten gallon water jugs on their heads] So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?
[Sandy starts to laugh and tears of laughter spew out and fill her helmet. Everyone frowns as tears start to well up in SpongeBob and Patrick's eyes']
SpongeBob: Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.
Sandy: [takes out the flusher handle, attaches it to her helmet and flushes the water out again] I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. [Everyone gathers around Sandy]
Sandy: Huh? Duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.
SpongeBob: Does that mean you'll stay?
Sandy: I'm staying! [Everyone cheers, except Squidward]
SpongeBob: That makes me feel all wiggly.
Patrick: Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas? [cheering stops; cut back to the Bikini Atoll]
Sandy: What did you just say?!
Patrick: Should I start running now?
Narrator: Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends. [shows fishermen in boats fishing near the Bikini Bottom atoll]
Squidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
SpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine. [uses himself as a cleaning tool]
Mr. Krabs: They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes! [everyone looks at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] The hooks! The hooks!
Fred: How about a mint?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! The hooks!
Tom: Can you make that to go?
Squidward: [gives Tom his food in a bag] You don't know how lucky you are.
Mr. Krabs: The hooks. So there I was, minding my own business...
Squidward: I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, um... I have to do my waste basket inspection. [puts a trashcan on his head] Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya.
SpongeBob: Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.
SpongeBob: The hooks?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. [shapes his arm like a hook as SpongeBob looks at his arm] The hooks. [The camera shows SpongeBob's face with a reflection with Mr. Krabs' arm as a hook] They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches... [grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgie. His drink decreases every time Mr. Krabs grabs his pants as he sips it] ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher  [he opens a hatch on the roof and points at the surface] until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse...
SpongeBob: [gasps] What could be worse than that?
Mr. Krabs: Gift shops. [shows gift shop and the inside of the gift shop]
SpongeBob: [gasps and hides under a box] Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. [goes in the kitchen with the box on him]
Patrick: [pokes his head through one of the kitchen windows] Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go.
SpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.
Patrick: It's not leaving. You're just taking a break. [SpongeBob goes outside behind unseen] We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni... [trips and falls on face] We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town. [many hooks are dangling] I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
SpongeBob: Where is everybody?
Patrick: I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier. [a pair of kids' sneakers lie on the ground nearby]
SpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... [bumps into a hook] Excuse me. [gasps as he sees the hook as the camera shows SpongeBob's face again with the reflection with a hook] Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
Patrick: [sits on a hook] Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
SpongeBob: All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
[Patrick is putting the cheese in his mouth]
Patrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it. [the hook where Patrick ate the cheese from is pulled up]
SpongeBob: [faces another hook with cheese attached to it] But, Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something. [the hook that SpongeBob is facing is pulled up. Patrick is shown with 9 hooks in his mouth and still has 1 in his hand] Does this look dangerous?
SpongeBob: [screams] Patrick, don't!
Patrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... [hooks pulls him up]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend. [Patrick floats down and SpongeBob runs into him as he hits the ground] Patrick, you're alive.
Patrick: Am I ever. You should try it.
SpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?
Patrick: You just jump off before you go up too high.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
Patrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? [he jumps on a fish-like attachment on the hook]
SpongeBob: Well, no.
Patrick: Wheeee.
SpongeBob: I guess he didn't. [he jumps on the attachment with Patrick]
Patrick: Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away! [The hook pulls them up. We see a fisherman reeling in his fishing rod. We see SpongeBob and Patrick laughing out of enjoyment. The camera alternates between the fisherman to SpongeBob and Patrick. After a few cuts, SpongeBob and Patrick are about to jump off]
SpongeBob: Ready?
Patrick: Ready.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Geronimo! [jump off]
SpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. [We cut to the exterior at the Krusty Krab when customers are muttering angrily. We cut to see Ivy mad with Harold]
Ivy: P.U., [points at his Krabby Patty] you call this food?!
Harold: My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
Another Harold: [Starts holding up his fried boot] My sandwich is a fried boot!
Fred: Hurry it up, will ya? We're hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it. [customers muttering angrily... all talking at once; Squidward frantically flipping burnt patties]
Henry Bart: Can you see, we’re hungry!
Squidward: [defensive] Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Squidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break. [Mr. Krabs laughs] What?
Mr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taken a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. [laughs] Now, what were you saying?
Squidward: He took a break.
Mr. Krabs: [stares in shocked silence, as his arms and nose fall off. He then storms out the front door] Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. [uses his nose to smell] Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help! [all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob]
Mr. Krabs: [uses his nose to smell again] They should be right here. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick float down as they are laughing]
Patrick: Again?
SpongeBob: Again!
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! No! No! No!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [pulling on hook] 1, 2, 3...
Mr. Krabs&#160;: Wait! Wait!
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...blastoff. [hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock]
Mr. Krabs: Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [sobs] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd... [SpongeBob and Patrick float back down while laughing] ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
SpongeBob: I...I...I...
Patrick: I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.
Mr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down?
SpongeBob: Gift shop?
Mr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna. [shows a can of tuna] With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise! [shows a jar of mayo while a female screams in the background]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [raises hands] We promise, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go.
[a hook pokes Mr. Krabs in the butt]
Mr. Krabs: [leaps up, holding his injured rear] Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck. [they turn and rub their own behinds]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. [Cuts to the exterior of SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [comes running out of the house] I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. [Patrick comes out from his rock]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way. [crashes into his furniture]
SpongeBob: I always go to work this way.
Patrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.
Patrick: Well, I had my fingers crossed.
SpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
SpongeBob: Umm...
Patrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun. [Patrick goes up and down the hooks] Come on, SpongeBob. You know you want to!
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another... [almost runs into a hook. Gasps] ...hook! [almost touches the hook but takes it back] Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never! [goes back to hook] Is this seat taken? [hook takes him up, but when he comes down and turns around, it is shown that he is hooked at the pants] Whew! Glad I got that out of my system. [gasps] I'm...hooked! And that means... [shows the tuna can with SpongeBob crammed inside] Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Pearl: Thanks, dad.
Mr. Krabs: Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
SpongeBob: Umm...no. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Of course not. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean, not exactly. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it! [cries] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked! [shows the hook to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy. [group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants]
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls. [hook pulls him closer] D’oh, okay. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off. [takes pants off] There.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... lad?
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. [he places a "Help Wanted" sign on the door] But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [hook pulls him a little closer] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise. [He holds on to a flower but the hook pulls him away. He holds on to the Krusty Krab signpost] Please save me, Mr. Krabs! [cries] I promise I'll be good! [underwear tears off] Whew. [the signpost flings him into the door naked, which makes the girls laugh]
Girls: Ooh, look! [laughs]
Pearl: It's SpongeBob NudeyPants! [SpongeBob screams and runs]
Squidward: [holding a fishing hook with SpongeBob's underwear on the hook] Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Squidward: Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. [both laugh. Shows SpongeBob running back to his house]
SpongeBob: The pants! The underwear! [cries]
Patrick: [bus drops off a can of tuna] Hello? Does somebody have a can opener?
Narrator: Ah, beautiful springtime. A time for fun and frolic for most... [The scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, zooming in and then right at the front door. Squidward is there] but not for this poor slob. [Referring to Squidward]
Squidward: Oh, what a beautiful day. And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol. [bell dings] No one ever comes in on Sunday. [bell dings again] Why can't Mr. Krabs just let us go home? [bell dings again. Squidward gets angry. The scene changes to to SpongeBob ringing a bell, set on the order window. Squidward runs up to SpongeBob] SpongeBob, stop ringing this bell! [He picks it up and slams it on the bottom of the order window]
SpongeBob: I was just testing it. [Squidward leans through the order window getting in SpongeBob's face]
Squidward: I will ring the bell when there's an order. But... [scene zooms out to show that the restaurant is empty] There's no customers! There hasn't been one all day and there isn't gonna be any! [he struggles to pick up the cash register, but successfully does so and he slams it down making a bell noise]
SpongeBob: One Krabby Patty coming up!
Squidward: No!
[The register drawer shoots open, knocking Squidward out of the way. A bunch of coins fall onto the floor. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs’ office where Mr. Krabs is writing something on a sheet of paper and he stops to hear the money dropping.]
Mr. Krabs: That sounds like me money dropping. [The scene changes to show the outside of the office and Squidward is picking up the coins. Mr. Krabs opens his office door.] What's going on out here?! My babies! [runs up to Squidward and shoves him away] Get away, you barbarian! What have you done? Nice, clean money... soiled! [scoops up the coins in his claws] I'll take care of ya. Let papa clean ya up. [The scene changes to show a long shot of SpongeBob staring out from the order window] Clear the way! [he runs into the kitchen and starts washing them off in the sink] No, no, no, don't cry, little ones.
SpongeBob: What's wrong, Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs gets startled and throws the dimes in the air. One dime rolls into the sink and starts to roll towards the sink drain]
Mr. Krabs: Me dime!  [The dime rolls around sink drain. Just as it seems like it's about to fall down the drain, it flips over facing away from the drain. Mr. Krabs gives a sigh of relief. Then the dime jumps, winks, and goes down the drain] No! [grabs the dime in the drain] I got it, boy! [tries to take his claw out] What the? It's stuck! You gotta help me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You've gotta let go of the dime.
Mr. Krabs: I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy. There's got to be another way! Grab me captain's quarters and heave! [SpongeBob pulls on Mr. Krabs from behind a couple times until Mr. Krabs gets thrown back without his arms] Me arms!
SpongeBob: Oh no, not again! [Mr. Krabs hits the wall, the impact causing the shelf above him to slant and drop a pot, a glass, a pan, a mug, a treasure chest, an anchor, a buoy, and a scuba suit on his head. A giant bump rises up on Mr. Krabs' head. and then a dime falls on it, causing Krabs to fall over and blacken out. Scene changes to show an ambulance outside the Krusty Krab and two paramedics start to carry out Mr. Krabs on a stretcher.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait. [The paramedics stop moving] Squidward... I'm putting you in charge of things around here while I'm gone.
Squidward: [smiles] You can count on me, sir! [The paramedics continue to carry Mr. Krabs out. A third paramedic carries out Mr. Krabs' arms] Take care, Hurry back. Get well soon. You're in our thoughts. [The final paramedic enters the ambulance and it drives off.] Takes more muscles to frown than to smile. [shuts the door] Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business. My first official act as new manager is to give you a promotion.
[SpongeBob's pupils form into stars]
SpongeBob: [screams] Ahh! Really?
Squidward: You get to run the cash register.
SpongeBob: The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?
Squidward: You are-- It's part of the promotion I mentioned earlier. You'll be wearing two hats now. You're gonna take the orders and then you're gonna make them! [puts his hat next to SpongeBob's hat]
SpongeBob: Ah... This is the best day of my life.
Squidward: Me, too.
SpongeBob: But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do?
Squidward: I've got some very important boss-like errands to run. See ya later. [he runs off]
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: [He is half-way out the door] What is it?
SpongeBob: You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register. [He rubs the cash register]
Squidward: You push the button and put the money inside. Okay, you're on your own. [walks off as SpongeBob hugs the cash register]
SpongeBob: I can't believe this is really happening. [sits on the cash register box. He starts to tear up.] Today, I start living! 
[The scene changes to show Squidward walking outside]
Squidward: Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time. A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering... With pay. Hmm... I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome... Oh, oh, it'll pass. He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face. [scene cuts to Squidward's imagination: Patrick and SpongeBob in the Krusty Krab with dopey looks on their faces]
Thought Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
Thought SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick!
Thought Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, could you give me change for a quarter? [holds up quarter]
Thought SpongeBob: No problem! [takes the quarter, bangs on the register until it opens, and gives Patrick a giant pile of money] Here ya go!
Thought Patrick: Thanks.
[the scene goes back to reality]
Squidward: [gasps] I forgot to tell him how to make change! Oh! [he runs back to the restaurant, banging the doors open] Sponge... [sees only SpongeBob in the Krusty Krab] ...Bob. [checks the cash register to see if everything is still there. Gives a sigh of relief]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands?
Squidward: No, I am not. I just remembered I needed change for this dollar. [He pulls out a dollar from his pocket]
SpongeBob: Do you want four quarters? [holds up four quarters] Or ten dimes? [shows ten dimes on his left hand] Or twenty nickels? [shows ten nickels on each arm] Or one hundred pennies? [shows one-hundred pennies on his back] Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies? [shows the quarter on his nose, 3 dimes on his fingers, 7 nickels on his thumb, and ten pennies, in the shape of the cent symbol, on his foot] Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are...
Squidward: Alright, goodbye. [walks off. Scene changes to show Squidward's house where he comes out wearing sunglasses and blue shorts or bathing suit, he is carrying a lawn chair, a sunbathing mirror, an umbrella hat and a bottle of sunscreen.] This is great. My day off, no worries, just relaxation. [sets his lawn chair down, puts the hat on, puts the mirror down, and puts sunscreen on his nose.] I'm the boss, I deserve this. Ah...
Squidward: [voice overThoughts] Everything will be fine. There won't be any customers today anyway. He'll probably just stand there, bored. [imagines SpongeBob behind the counter just standing there. Squidward chuckles.] SpongeBob, bored. [he chuckles some more]
Thought SpongeBob: Ehh... Gettin' kinda bored. [yawns and falls asleep snoring. Krusty Krab spontaneously combusts and Squidward tries to blow it out but it's a thought bubble, so it goes away. Begins to run to the Krusty Krab, but stops.]
Squidward: Oh, what am I doing? [he pulls out a pocket watch] I am wasting valuable relaxing time, that's what I'm doing! I mean, really. What are the odds? SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire. [he walks back down the road, chuckling. Then, a fire truck drives down the road from to direction of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is startled and runs to the restaurant with a fire extinguisher. He opens the door and sprays the galley with foam. As the foam subsides, Squidward, now with a foam beard, walks over to SpongeBob, who has a foam mustache]
SpongeBob: May I help you, sir?
Squidward: [wipes off his foamy beard] It's me, you dunce!
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward! [mustache falls off] How are those errands going?
Squidward: What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm sure you are.
Squidward: I don't like your tone.
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] I'm sure you are. [normal voice again] How's that?
Squidward: Just do your jobs! [walks off]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles. [puts the spatula in his forehead. Squidward leaves, grumbling.] Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge. [The scene changes to show Squidward's house. The scene zooms into the interior. Squidward is trying to sit down.]
Squidward: Must... re... [cracks his back] ...lax! [He slouches in his chair. He pulls out a hand mirror] Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow! Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me: you will not go back to the Krusty Krab. [his reflection turns into SpongeBob]
Mirror SpongeBob: I will destroy the Krusty Krab! [Squidward screams and throws the mirror at the wall while it shatters and runs to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Have you finished...?
Squidward: No! [walks out] That's it. That's it. No matter what sick fantasies run through my mind, I will not go back to that restaurant! [walks into his house then runs out towards the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs back to his house then back to the Krusty Krab] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs back to his house] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward keeps running back and forth while SpongeBob is repeating 'have you finished those errands?' Finally, Squidward enters the Krusty Krab and stops] Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?
Squidward: No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be, so quit checking up on me! [walks up to SpongeBob] I know what you're up to. [He hits the cash register while he talks] Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!
SpongeBob: But I haven't...
Squidward: Okay, [He leans on the cash register] maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will. You will... [He slowly loses his sanity as he walks backwards] And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there! [He laughs hysterically and runs away]
SpongeBob: Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear [Rubs his hats] these hats. 
[The scene changes to show Squidward locking his door using his key, putting padlocks on it, bolting it down with wood and nails, putting police tape up, and using a blowtorch to weld the door shut so he can't get out]
Squidward: There! [He throws the blowtorch backwards] Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself! [His face looks weird because he has lost his sanity] I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care. [laughs] Just gonna... Relax. [He walks to his shower, turns on the water, puts on his bathing cap and sits in his bathtub] Let Squid's day off...[Under the bath water] begin. [Squidward hears SpongeBob laughing] [above the bath water] What was that? [SpongeBob's laughing is heard again] It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me to see if I'm really doing errands. [gives a chuckle] But, but he left his post. [Gives another chuckle] And I've finally caught him messing up. [Gives another chuckle. He pokes his head out the window.] Aha! I caught you, Sponge... [notices that it's only the wind making a branch of coral brush against his house] ... Branch. [Squidward notices SpongeBob's silhouette with his two hats behind his shower curtain] Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get. [pulls the curtain aside] I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a... [Sees his toilet with a shampoo bottle and 2 rolls of toilet paper on it] ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say...
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. [SpongeBob is in the bathtub with Squidward.] Are you finished with those errands yet? [goes under the water]
Squidward: Aha! [goes under the water and appears as a real octopus with a demonic voice] I know you're in here. [gasps] What? [SpongeBob is in the drain. He winks and goes down] He's heading back to the Krusty Krab! [Jumps out of his bathtub and runs to the door] I'll beat him there! [slams through the barricaded door with nothing on but his shower cap and bubbles foaming around his waist] I've got you now, SpongeBob! [runs past Sadie who covers her son's eyes with her hand]
Sadie: Hey, put some clothes on!
Squidward: [runs past Patrick lying on a rock] The truth will be revealed!
Patrick: [stands up] Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward! [The scene changes to show the hospital where Purple Doctorfish and Mr. Krabs are walking out]
Purple Doctorfish: Okay, Mr. Krabs. Get plenty of rest and if things don't seem right, come back. [walks inside]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, Doc. [He looks at the street and smiles until the nude and deranged Squidward runs past him]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you can't beat me! [Mr. Krabs frowns, his arms fall off again and he walks back into the hospital. Laughing hysterically, Squidward bursts into Krusty Krab to find SpongeBob already there as he never left] AHA! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha! Or the toilet in my bathroom! [SpongeBob looks confused and Squidward's saliva hits his face] And then you were in my bathtub, and [He slowly regains his sanity] I... and-and you... and I... and then you... swam... down the drain... and... beat me... to the Krusty... Krab.
SpongeBob: Uh, does that mean you're...? [Squidward covers SpongeBob's mouth with his hand]
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands. [hugs the register] I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do. 
[He rubs his face on the cash register. SpongeBob takes off his clothes (except his underwear) and hands them to Squidward]
SpongeBob: [Whispers] Then you might wanna put these on. [Squidward looks down and notices a bunch of bubbles. Close up of his legs and all the bubbles pop except for one, which pops after the close up, he grabs SpongeBob's pants and puts them on.] Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look! [walks back with the "open""closed" sign] We forgot to switch the "Closed" sign to "Open". [flips the sign from "Closed" to "Open"]. It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off! [He laughs. Squidward's nose falls off and his head deflates. His whole body soon falls gently to the ground.]
Narrator: Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life. [chuckles] Well, you know. [Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy]
Patrick: An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. [arrow on top of rock breaks] Jellyfish, I got an award. [jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface] Island, I got an awar... [chokes for air and floats back down] I gotta show SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [building a house of cards looking like Gary] Hold still, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Almost done. [Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor; Gary flies away]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]
SpongeBob: That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
Patrick: See for yourself.
SpongeBob: [his body is facedown, but his face come out and reads the award] "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
Patrick: But, it's shiny. [SpongeBob takes the trophy]
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
Patrick: Ice cream!
SpongeBob: Exactly!
Patrick: I can find it. Is it in here?
SpongeBob: No, don't! That's my... [Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet] ...award closet.
Patrick: I want an award! [starts to cry]
Narrator: Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.
Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the Krabby Patty, with its top secret formula, known only to those who are brave enough and intelligent enough to comprehend its culinary complexity. [SpongeBob is balancing a spatula on his nose behind the register]
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it!
Mr. Krabs: Quit fooling around, SpongeBob, we got customers.
Narrator: But wherever there's a secret recipe, there is someone who wants to steal it. [Plankton laughs evilly while standing in the head of a robot fish. The head falls down]
Plankton: Ouch! [robot's arm turns into a mirror] And now for the final touch. [puts on a mustache] Perfect! With this disguise, that formula is as good as mine. [laughs then wheels himself into the restaurant]
Fish Robot: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants? [SpongeBob looks in a mirror]
SpongeBob: Why, yes. Yes I am. [the fish robot holds up a big check]
Fish Robot: Then you've just won one million dollars! [SpongeBob gasps] You just have to answer one question. What is the Krabby Patty secret formula? [SpongeBob inhales] Yes? [SpongeBob inhales more] Yes? [SpongeBob inhales even more] Yes?!
SpongeBob: [speaking rapidly fast] The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary. [SpongeBob smiles, the mustache falls off the robot, shakes, then Plankton crashes through the teeth]
Plankton: [growls] That's it?! [jumps on SpongeBob's nose and holds his eyelids] You'd better cough up that secret formula or else!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton!
Plankton: [Looks at Mr. Krabs] Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton!
Plankton: Krabs!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob. [Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton and a straw, then puts Plankton in the straw]
Plankton: You can't do this to me, Krabs! [Mr. Krabs blows Plankton back to the Chum Bucket] I went to college! [Plankton crashes into his restaurant] Ouch.
Mr. Krabs: That Plankton is a clever beast. You've got to keep a sharp eye out for him, SpongeBob. The Krabby Patty law must be enforced. The future of the Krusty Krab depends on it.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square, [grabs himself] and this sponge is Bob, [lifts his arms up] I will not let you down!
Mr. Krabs: Uh, SpongeBob? [camera zooms out to reveal SpongeBob holding Mr. Krabs above his head] Could you let me down? [cut to later, at the Krusty Krab]
Fish: Man, these patties sure are delicious. I wonder what's in that secret formula. [siren goes off. SpongeBob slides down the pole from the crow's nest]
SpongeBob: Code twelve, code twelve! [SpongeBob bounces off a trampoline and grabs the customer's head] Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton! [pulls the head off to reveal a smaller head on the customer; everyone gasps]
Fish: Everyone at the head enhancement clinic said nobody would notice! [runs off crying]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're scaring away me money!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula.
Mr. Krabs: That's no reason to rip other people's heads off, boy. Just remember the most important rule.
SpongeBob: No free napkins?
Mr. Krabs: No! the other most important rule. Regarding the secret formula.
SpongeBob: Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: As long as you do that, the secret is safe.
Squidward: I always thought the most important rule was "why do today what you can put off till tomorrow?" [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What is today, but yesterday's tomorrow?
Squidward: Huh? [cut to Mr. Krabs and Squidward in a storage room]
Mr. Krabs: Today, I want you to take inventory on everything in here; every last pickle and patty must be accounted for.
Squidward: Aye aye, captain. [Mr. Krabs leaves. When Squidward walks over to the stock, glowing eyes appear; Squidward writes something on a notepad] Two boxes of buns. Three pounds of patties.
Imitation Krabs: [mechanical voice] Mr. Squidward...
Squidward: What now, Mr. Krabs?
Imitation Krabs: That's right, I am Krabs.
Plankton: Your boss, your ruler, your master! [laughs evilly]
Imitation Krabs: Ha, ha, ha. [exhaust smoke spurts out]
Squidward: You're not Mr. Krabs.
Imitation Krabs: Hey, why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Squidward: [chuckles and runs to the door] Well... whatever you say, "Mr. Krabs." [laughs] Whoopee! [runs out as SpongeBob walks in]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Plankton: Oh, sweet domination. This is it!
SpongeBob: No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good. [touches his body] Ooh, you're so cold. [knocks on his pants]
Imitation Krabs: That's just my metal suit. I made it to protect the formula.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [second "SpongeBob!" echos]
Plankton: It's that thick-headed Krabs. He'll ruin everything.
Imitation Krabs: Look, a jellyfish. [SpongeBob takes out his net and runs around]
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it.[Plankton presses the "Abort" button. When he does, Imitation Krabs shrinks into a toaster] I got it, I got it [Mr. Krabs enters]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob stops and looks at the toaster, which releases its toast, then looks at Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: [knocks on Mr. Krabs' pants] Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?
Mr. Krabs: Don't get all loopy on me, boy. I need your help. And where in the high seas is Squidward?
SpongeBob: You gave him the day off.
Mr. Krabs: [pupils shrink] Day... [bellows] ...oooooooooff?! [Mr. Krabs is so mad that he makes steam come out of the chimney] I don't know the meaning of them horrible words! [SpongeBob falls down] Now quit your laying around, SpongeBob, and take out that garbage! It's starting to give me a rash. [exits]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! [puts a clothespin on his nose and is going to take the trash out, but Imitation Krabs stops him] Hey, Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage.
Imitation Krabs: Never mind that. I need to talk to you. [takes the trash bag and vaporizes it with his laser eyes]
SpongeBob: Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs. I didn't know you had heat vision.
Imitation Krabs: Never mind. I need you to tell me...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
Imitation Krabs: Yoinks! [runs off]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around. [gives him a spatula] Get back to the kitchen!
SpongeBob: But I thought you wanted to ask me a question.
Mr. Krabs: Yes... why aren't you working harder?
SpongeBob: [slowly] I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know. [both walk out]
Plankton: I'll never get that formula with that pest Krabs popping in and out like that. I've got it! I've been saving this for a rainy day. [holds up a penny] It looks like an ordinary penny... because it is an ordinary penny! That fool Krabs is too greedy to ignore you, my little pretty. [laughs evilly. The penny pops out of the nose and rolls around into Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: That sound, it sounds like... the pitter-patter of... [sees the penny] money! [squeals] Hey, where you going, beautiful? [SpongeBob knocks on Mr. Krabs' door]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs... [the penny slides out of the office] Wha... [Mr. Krabs busts down the door on top of SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Stop! Please! [the penny slides between the crack of the doors and rolls away with Mr. Krabs running after it] Wait! [Robot Krabs is hiding behind the sign pole]
Imitation Krabs: Nothing stands between me and that secret formula now. [snaps off some of the Krusty Krab sign pole. As he laughs evilly, the sign falls on top of him] Ouch! [cut to SpongeBob, who is scrubbing the floor]
SpongeBob: Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub. [Robot Mr. Krabs rolls by] Hey, Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'.
Imitation Krabs: Hello, SpongeBob, it is me, Mr. Krabs. [exhaust pipe smokes] In the flesh. [exhaust pipe smokes again] Standing right in front of you. [pipe smokes again] With no one else around.
SpongeBob: I can see that, Mr. Krabs.
Imitation Krabs: I thought we might discuss the Krabby Patty secret formula. [a microphone comes out of Imitation Krabs]
SpongeBob: Isn't that a microphone?
Imitation Krabs: What? Why, yes it is. [puts microphone back inside his body] I must get this shirt cleaned. Alright, now tell me the secret formula.
SpongeBob: But, sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet.
Imitation Krabs: Oh yes. Here, let's shake.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We don't shake with our hands, remember?
Imitation Krabs: Uh, right, why don't you start?
SpongeBob: We stand on one foot. [they do] Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem. [they do]
Music: "Bikini Bottom National Anthem"
Oh, Bikini Bottom, we pledge our hearts to you, As faithful, as deep, as true, as blue, Bikini Bottom, we love you!
Imitation Krabs: Formula time?
SpongeBob: Almost.
Narrator: Six and a half hours later... [Plankton grunts frantically as he gets Robot Krabs into a cannon which spits him out, through a flame ring, and onto a chair at a table. He opens up the robot's belt buckle and dumps some spaghetti in there]
Imitation Krabs: Yum yum, this spaghetti sure is good. Belch!
SpongeBob and Plankton: Meatball. Meatball. Spaghetti underneath. Ravioli. Ravioli. Great Barrier Reef. [They clap]
Imitation Krabs: Okay, now let's hear that formula.
SpongeBob: Sorry, [takes off his chef mustache] no can do, Mr. Krabs. [Robot Krabs' eyes are on fire]
Imitation Krabs: Whaaaaaaaaaat?!
Plankton: [exploding in rage] But we did everything you said-- I followed all the rules! I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!
Imitation Krabs: Now why can't you tell me the formula?
SpongeBob: It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle. [holds up a bottle with a piece of paper in it]
Plankton: [Imitation Krabs opens its eyes, Plankton is overly excited and tense] This is it, Plankton. Gently, now... [pushes on a lever that makes Robot Krabs' arm stretch out more. A penny rolls through the door and Mr. Krabs comes in. Everyone gasps, including the guy on the penny]
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps]
SpongeBob: [Gasps]
Guy on the Penny: [Gasps]
Imitation Krabs: Gasp!
Mr. Krabs: How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!
Imitation Krabs: Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. Remember: Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the real Mr. Krabs.
Imitation Krabs: Don't listen to him. He's obviously a robot. [exhaust pipe smokes]
Mr. Krabs: Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together. Not some rusted-out, steam-driven piece of junk!
Imitation Krabs: Who are you calling steam-driven...?
SpongeBob: [unable to handle the pressure, explodes in frustration] Quiet! [SpongeBob is holding a giant hose in his hands and his eyes bloodshot] Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves, [it is soon revealed that the hose is attached to a large tartar sauce machine] nobody gets hurt.
Mr. Krabs and Imitation Krabs: Tartar sauce?!
Mr. Krabs: Take it easy with that thing, son. [SpongeBob squirts some tartar sauce at Mr. Krabs causing him to jump into Imitation Krabs' arms]
SpongeBob: I'll do the talking around here. I think I'll just ask you two a couple of questions. Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, then.
SpongeBob: First question: What time does the Krusty Krab open?
Imitation Krabs:  [beats Mr. Krabs to it] 9:30 A.M.
SpongeBob: Right. [to Mr. Krabs] That's one strike, Mr. Fake.
Mr. Krabs: But...
SpongeBob: Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two: How much does a Krabby Patty cost?
Mr. Krabs: $2.99!
SpongeBob: On Wednesday...
Imitation Krabs: 99¢!
SpongeBob: Right again! [to Mr. Krabs] You're starting to look pretty phony right about now. I'd be nervous if I were you. Now only the really real Mr. Krabs could answer this — If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do?
Mr. Krabs: That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass? [Mr. Krabs is shot out of the Krusty Krab with tartar sauce into a fry basket] Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance! [Rolls away in the basket] No!
SpongeBob: So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye! [walks back inside] I knew it was you all along, Mr. Krabs, here you go. [holds up the formula bottle]
Imitation Krabs: Thank you, SpongeDupe. [grabs the bottle and laughs mechanically. SpongeBob sees a penny on the ground]
SpongeBob: Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny. [puts the penny inside a slot on Imitation Krabs that is labeled "Self-Destruct: 1 cent"]
Imitation Krabs: Yoinks.
SpongeBob: This must be your lucky day. [laughs]
Karen: The self-destruct coin slot has been activated. Ten seconds 'til detonation.
Plankton: Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas. Heeeeeeeeeeeeeelp! [screams as he wheels back to the Chum Bucket, but explodes when he gets inside. The giant hand thuds on top of him] Ouch! [the formula bottle rolls back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Picks up the formula, realizing his mistake] If that was Plankton... Uh-oh!
Mr. Krabs: Help! Get Away! No!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs! [runs to Mr. Krabs, who is still in the fry basket using a fry to fight off Hans who has a fork]
Hans: Mmm…yum-yum.
Mr. Krabs: Back, you hungry hand, back! Help! [SpongeBob wheels Mr. Krabs back to the Krusty Krab safely]
SpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony.
Mr. Krabs: Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again. [takes the bottle] However, that penny's coming out of your paycheck. [both laugh]
SpongeBob: Really?
Narrator: Ah, Sandy Cheeks is going out of town and has asked SpongeBob and Patrick to do a little pet-sitting for her. [inside the dome are a few animals in cages andor jars]
Patrick: Pet-sitting? Won't that hurt them? [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a bird cage]
Narrator: Perhaps she should have asked someone else. [Patrick whistles at the bird]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird.
Patrick: No, that's Italian, SpongeBob. [Sandy puts a big sack down]
Sandy: Okay boys, this here is Birdy's food. Feed him twice a day.
SpongeBob: This whole sack?
Sandy: No, just a cup's worth. [all walk over to a cricket] This here's my cricket. [the cricket makes noises] He's saying hello to you. Ain't he cute?
SpongeBob: Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian.
Sandy: And this here's Snakey. [holds up the snake that has a mouse in its belly]
SpongeBob: What's that lump in its belly?
Sandy: Well, that's his dinner. [SpongeBob pokes it and the mouse laughs] Well, I guess that's it. I gotta go. [walks off with a suitcase] See you guys in a couple of days.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bye, Sandy! [notices the worm in a jar]
SpongeBob: ['gasps] Wait! You forgot about this pet!
Sandy: Oh, that's only Wormy. He don't eat much. [walks out]
SpongeBob: Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella.
Patrick: Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo.
SpongeBob: Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play. [cut to SpongeBob playing hide-n-seek and counting] 998, 999, 1, 000. Ready or not, here I come! [turns around and takes the table cover off of Patrick's head]
Patrick: You found me. [both look for Wormy, who is on a leaf]
SpongeBob and Patrick: There you are! [cuts to Sponge and Pat hiding behind a tree. Wormy pops up behind it] He found us! [they laugh]
Patrick: Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever.
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy. [puts a 'Best Friend' ribbon on Wormy] Our new best friend. [puts Wormy back in his jar] Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun.
Patrick: Why must the sun set on this perfect day? Sleep well, Wormy. [Patrick cries as they both walk home]
SpongeBob: Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. [cut to Bikini Atoll] It's only until tomorrow.
[day turns into night. Ominous music plays as a live-action Wormy makes a cocoon and turns into a butterfly. Cut to dawn and the rooster crows when SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Here I come, Wormy! [Patrick pokes his head out of SpongeBob's alarm clock]
Patrick: Me, too! [both run off to Sandy's with their water helmets already on] And then we're gonna play tag, and then we're gonna color, and then we're gonna build a house of cards!
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're back, Wormy! Wormy, Wormy? [holds up the jar with the butterfly]
Patrick: Wormy? Where's Wormy? What's that thing?
SpongeBob: He's gotta be in here. [opens up the jar and the butterfly flies out onto SpongeBob's jar] I think something bad happened to Wormy. [the best friend ribbon is still in the jar]
Patrick: He left his "Best Friend" ribbon behind! [the butterfly flies onto SpongeBob's helmet. Cut to a real life close-up on a horsefly as buzzing sounds play in the background. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run behind Sandy's table]
Patrick: What is that thing? [the butterfly is on the tree]
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!
Patrick: [In tears] Why does this keep happening to me?!
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick! We've gotta make a run for the door! [They start to run to the exit but the butterfly flies on the door] No! Patrick, it’s blocking our only exit! [They begin to run backwards to the back of Sandy's tree]
Patrick: Now what? We're trapped in here with that...that--"Best Friend Eater!"
SpongeBob: Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember, it's two against one. Right, Patrick? Patrick? [He sees Patrick gone and the butterfly flying at him and shrieks] It’s eaten Patrick! [He runs away and jumps in a barrel and sees Patrick in it] Patrick, you're alive!
Patrick: I am?
SpongeBob: Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets!
Patrick: Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets.
SpongeBob: No, it might eat Sandy! We've gotta get it out of here!
[We see SpongeBob and Patrick hiding behind Sandy's table and Sandy's phone in a jar to trap the butterfly and the phone begins to ring]
Patrick: It's for you! [The butterfly begins to fly by the jar]
SpongeBob: It's working. It’s gonna answer it. [But instead the butterfly just flies past the jar and the lid closes]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
[Then we see Patrick on a plate with an apple in his mouth]
SpongeBob: You look pretty appetizing, Patrick. Now, just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net. [He walks off and the butterfly begins to fly by and land on Patrick's butt which makes Patrick feel scared]
Patrick: [Whimpering, spitting out the apple] SpongeBob! Hurry up with that net!
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick! [He searches through Sandy's trunk for the net.]
Patrick: I really don't taste that good, Monster. [Wormy crawls down Patrick's helmet. Patrick sees the butterfly close-up and runs off screaming. SpongeBob runs by with the net]
SpongeBob: I'm coming, Patrick! [Patrick goes right through the net, tearing it up, and crashes into the tree, causing some acorns to fall into his helmet. SpongeBob sees his broken net as Wormy corners him] No, Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! Please! Wait a second. [takes out a bottle of bubbles and blows one to get Wormy stuck in one] Yeah! [Wormy flies out of the treedome, still in the bubble. Patrick shuts the door behind Wormy] We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now...[Wormy flies to the Krusty Krab]...heading straight for the Krusty Krab! [both run off] It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance. [both go inside a rock and then appear inside the Krusty Krab in another rock. They gasp as Wormy flies toward Squidward and Mr. Krabs, who are taking pictures]
Squidward: Okay, hold still.
Patrick: It's gonna eat Squidward and Mr. Krabs! [both jump at them]
SpongeBob: Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Say "money."
Mr. Krabs: "Money!" [Squidward takes the picture. It reveals SpongeBob and Patrick jumping on top of Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there.
Mr. Krabs: Is it a paying customer?
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU!
Patrick: [crying] Just like it ate Wormy!
Squidward: Um, Wormy? [SpongeBob and Patrick cry]
SpongeBob: Why? Why? He was so young.
Patrick: We’ll never forget you, Wormy.
Squidward: Well, if Moron Theater's over, I'm just going to take a look at this monster. [Wormy flies in a bubble] That's the monster?
Patrick: Pretty scary, huh?
SpongeBob: A living nightmare!
Squidward: I should have known. [walks away] Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express.
Mr. Krabs: Now just 'cause you swabs never seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous.
SpongeBob: We tried to warn them. I can't watch. [pushes his eyes into his head]
Squidward: Get a load of the scary monster. [laughs] Monster.
Mr. Krabs: Aw, it looks harmless.
Squidward: It's kinda cute.
Mr. Krabs: It reminds me of money.
Squidward: Monster. [both laugh until they see the butterfly up-close and personal. Squidward and Mr. Krabs scream as their teeth and eyes fall out and they both run away]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Patrick: Mr. Krabs? [SpongeBob screams when he sees their underwear and hat only]
SpongeBob: [screams] It ate them! And there it goes! [Wormy flies out of the Krusty Krab] First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs! [has three finger puppets for each person] That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must inform the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The faith of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll.
Patrick: Aye-aye, captain. [pushes a lever to make the boat sail out of the Krusty Krab. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the streets]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity.
Patrick: Gotcha.
SpongeBob: Run, everybody, run!
Patrick: Monster on the loose!
SpongeBob: Monster! [everyone runs away screaming. SpongeBob and Patrick give each other a thumbs up. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick putting up a sign of the butterfly saying "Beware" when a crowd of citizens runs by screaming. Wormy flies by and SpongeBob and Patrick hide in the bucket of glue and bounce off. Cut to SpongeBob inflating a balloon but then inhales the air in the balloon so he can float in the sky]
Patrick: [using a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you!
Fish #1, Gerbil, TV Fish, and Fish #2:  A monster?! [everyone screams and runs away. Cut to SpongeBob waving his arms and horrifyingly pointing at Wormy flying by. Everybody runs off, and in the commotion, a lamppost gets knocked over and the whole city is set on fire.]
Realistic Fish Head: Attention, attention! This just in! [TV shows a real monarch butterfly] A giant monster is attacking Bikini Bottom. [a man watching the announcement swallows his eyes and has them appear in his mouth when he screams. He runs through the wall]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved the city! [In the background, a meteor flies down and destroys a building] Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster.
Patrick: About the what? [just then, Wormy flies by. SpongeBob, Patrick, and everyone else run away from Wormy, but Wormy always finds them no matter where they go. Eventually, the crowd stops at a traffic light to allow another crowd through. The first crowd passes as well, and soon enough, Wormy stops at the light, too. The crowd runs inside of a building, and Wormy enters as well. In the struggle to get out, all of the citizens are ejected through the chimney. Cut to the crowd running. As SpongeBob screams, his mouth engulfs the camera. Bikini Bottom's welcome sign snaps in half, and a "Beware" poster drifts through the wind. Then, a bus drops off Sandy. Sandy sees the destroyed town]
Sandy: Shoot! Looks like a twister hit this place. Where is everybody? [Wormy flies by] Oh, hey there Wormy. [puts him in a jar] You weren't supposed to change till I got back. That oughta hold ya, little guy. [everyong runs up to Sandy, Spongebob also gives Sandy a hug.] Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Sandy caught the monster! [everyone cheers and picks up SpongeBob and Sandy and bring them into town]
Sandy: I didn't know I'd be missed so much. Golly, maybe I should go out of town more often.
Sandy: There we go! [Sandy rakes a pile of leaves in the shape of Texas] SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra... [steps on piles of leaves still on the ground] SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!
SpongeBob: [peeks his head out of a pile of leaves he is in] I am raking the leaves.
Sandy: But they're still all over the ground!
SpongeBob: Sandy, I can't rake any faster. [picks up a leaf and starts scraping it with a tiny rake] These are big leaves. [leaf breaks into more pieces] And they keep breaking into more leaves.
Sandy: [Sandy pushes him away and rakes them herself] Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late!
SpongeBob: What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
Sandy: [hanging laundry] I told ya, SpongeBob... [scrubs the birdbath with a toothbrush] I'm hibernating next week.
SpongeBob: Hibernating? What's that?
Sandy: [painting the fence] It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.
SpongeBob: Can I do that?
Sandy: [chuckles] No, silly. It's a mammalian thing. [paints over SpongeBob's helmet]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
Sandy: [cleaning her exercise wheel] Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!
SpongeBob: Why, Sandy? When does your... "carburation" begin? [Sandy jumps down, pulling down a giant calendar with a giant x on the 8th]
Sandy: In one week!
SpongeBob: But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3... [gasps] 168 more hours of playtime!
Sandy: You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!
SpongeBob: Climb!
Sandy: We gotta jump off of stuff!
SpongeBob: Jump!
Sandy: We gotta ride!
SpongeBob: Ride!
Sandy: I don't wanna go to sleep yet!
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! [Sandy starts to cry]
Sandy: I can't burn carbs in my sleep!
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: What?!
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you. [Pantera playing]
Sandy: Well, I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands! [holds them up. Cut to the giant sand mountains area. Sandy is riding a giant clam shell smashing through a sign] Yee-ha! [sliding down the mountain so fast she is now on fire. She rides past a fish with a backpack on his back. When she goes past him, he drops to the ground and rolls around cause he is on fire. She then rides past a man and a woman. The woman now wears a jogging outfit and the man is now riding a tricycle and holding a lollipop and paddleball. The woman looks at him]
Unnamed Fish #1: Uh... I can explain. [Sandy flips in mid-air, still on fire]
Sandy: I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo! [SpongeBob is wearing his green karate head gear and riding down the mountain on his tongue. Cut to two kids, building a sandman]
Girl: Maybe, if we sing that song, he'll come to life.
Billy: Ready?
Both: [singing] Oh, there once was a sandman... [SpongeBob rides into the sandman. a musical note pops up]
SpongeBob: Life's as extreme as you want to make it! [jumps off the mountain] Whoo!
Girl: Maybe we didn't sing it right. [SpongeBob is flying toward the ground. When he hits it, two bones are sticking out]
SpongeBob: Yeah. [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob standing outside Sandy's treedome] Whew, what a workout. [pulls out his right arm and shows its damages] I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow. [his arm falls to the ground] Ow.
Sandy: I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best pre-hibernation week ever.
SpongeBob: Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again. [sighs as he lifts up his left leg and moves it alternately with the other over to his house. Later, it's nighttime and he is finally crawling into bed] Good night, Gary. [falls asleep. Then Sandy pushes a button which launches SpongeBob out of his bed and into a lake. SpongeBob is now a block of ice. Sandy jumps in and becomes a block of ice]
Sandy: Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [shivering] W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? [Sandy pulls down a calendar]
Sandy: I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun. [swims away] Well, hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour! [cut to SpongeBob lifting a bowling ball into a tube. Sandy blows her whistle giving the signal and SpongeBob runs to the end and picks up a few jacks before the bowling ball hits him on his head. Sandy does the same thing but the bowling ball cracks her helmet] Isn't this great?
SpongeBob: Yeah! I've never played extreme jacks before! [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob with giant q-tips]
Sandy: Okay, SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun. We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off. [lifts hers up] On your mark... get set...
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?
Sandy: Go! [hits SpongeBob off the Sea Needle. SpongeBob lands on a fire hydrant. Sandy rides up on a two-seated bike] Come on, SpongeBob. We're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!
SpongeBob: Gee, that sounds safe! I mean, fun. [gets up but leaves a piece of himself on the fire hydrant. He jumps on the bike] Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy!
Sandy: I did, SpongeBob, the industrial park! [they ride into a giant factory] This is where the real action is! [Sandy pedals on barbed wire] This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on! [they ride through a conveyor belt with a giant crunching mouth at the end] I hope we make it! [bike begins to fall to the ground fast. SpongeBob screams] I'm havin' fun, too! [as they hit the ground, SpongeBob melts into a puddle. Sandy tosses a fishing rod on him] Wake up, slowpoke. [scene scrolls over to show a plane] We're going fly-fishing. [rimshot]
SpongeBob: [thinking] This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle! [sees his shoe floating] Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.
Sandy: What is it?
SpongeBob: Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of... [his mouth melts away from his eyes. He pulls it back up] I just feel like maybe I need to... [his mouth melts away again. Sandy puts her hand over his mouth]
Sandy: Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite! [holds up a piece of hay. Pantera plays again] Find the hay in the needle stack! [throws it in a giant pile of needles]
SpongeBob: [bites his fingers in fear. Cut to inside the needle pile where SpongeBob is saying "ow" as he gets pricked by the needles. One needle pricks his nose, causing it to deflate like a balloon. Deep voice] Ouch...
Sandy: Did you find it?
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Sandy: Well I'm going to look over here!
SpongeBob: You do that. [SpongeBob digs a hole underground then emerges]
Sandy: Found it, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs away] Come on! Best two out of three.
SpongeBob: Gotta hide! Uh-G-Gotta hide! [looks at his house] Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret. [looks at Patrick's rock] Under a rock? It's so original! [as he jumps for the rock, his pants get stuck on a small coral bush]
Sandy: SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob struggles to get free and eventually does, but leaves his pants stuck on the plant] SpongeBob? [Sandy walks up to SpongeBob's pants] Where are you, little square dude? [gasps] SpongeBob's tie! And all his other little dressins! But... but... he always folds his clothes before running around in the nude! Something terrible must have happened to him! [crunching and munching] Alright, listen up, y'all! I'm rounding up a search party! SpongeBob's gone missing! [Squidward smiles at Mr. Krabs, thinking that Mr. Krabs will not look for SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward an angry look.]
Mr. Krabs: [Squidward frowns because they will search for SpongeBob] Man the lifeboats!
Sandy: Alpha Team, you search uptown, Gold Team searches downtown. Any questions?
Frank: Gold Team rules!
Sandy: Now get movin'! [crowd yelling] [Fred put a Lost poster with a picture of SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [Cuts to Sandy and the search party] Someone look up there! [Sandy pops out of a sewer] Put your doors, and friends into it! [cut to searching in the sulfur fields] Come on! He could be anywhere in these sulfur fields! [Clay looks in a spout]
Clay: Hey, SpongeBob! [a blast of sulfur hits him in the face] Well…, at least I still have my personality.
Sandy: Check in this here moist cave! [Old Man Jenkins, Nathaniel and Scooter walk in shouting for SpongeBob then run out, realizing the cave is actually a three-eyed sea elephant]
Sandy: Status report!
Small Fish: [covered in Poison Sea Urchins] He's not at the Poison Sea Urchin cove.
Sandy: Well, look again!
Vera: [covered in leeches] He's not at the leech farm.
Sandy: Well, look again!
Squidward: He's not in my thoughts.
Sandy: Well, think again! [cut to Sandy talking into a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!
Squidward: How about a break?! We've been at it for days!
Debbie: Think about the children!
Sandy: That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.
Frank: [whispering to Sadie] This is a load of barnacles.
Sandy: I heard that! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!
Frank: Uh... uh, wait! [picks up Francis] Uh, here he is!
Sandy: That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!
[Frank shapes Francis into a square]
Francis:  [in a poor imitation of SpongeBob] I'm ready! I'm ready!
Sandy: No you ain't! [Clay holds up a box of Kelp-O]
Clay: I found SquareBob!
Sandy: That's just a cereal box. Besides, he's yellow.
Charlie: [holds up a banana] Uh... here he is! Hey, can I go home now? [Sandy becomes annoyed]
Tina: [points up] Oh, look! He's up in the sky! [Sandy happily looks up, but SpongeBob's not in the sky]
Sandy: He's not...huh? [everyone is gone] They must have gone to search some more. [Sandy continues searching for SpongeBob] SpongeBob, where are you?! [lifts up a house] You under there?! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house where the unnamed fish from before is at]
Unnamed Fish #1: Uhh, I can explain.
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join Bikini Bottom's noblest, boldest, oldest superheroes as they bravely prepare for vacation. [both pack their clothes into their bags while the words “FOLD” and “PACK” come up] But wait! While our heroes relax at Leisure Village, who will watch the Mermalair? [Barnacle Boy opens the doors and SpongeBob and Patrick jump in]
SpongeBob: ManSponge...
Patrick: ...and BoyPatrick...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Reporting for duty!
Barnacle Boy: Yeah, yeah, follow me.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Up, up, and away!
Mermaid Man: Evil!
Barnacle Boy: Now, we want you boys to keep an eye on the place. Water the plants, and make sure that...
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh, Patrick! This is the greatest wall of superhero secret gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!
Patrick: I get the Aqua-Glove!
Mermaid Man: Hold on there, boys! You cannot play with this stuff!
SpongeBob: What about the Orb of Confusion? [turns the orb on and makes confused faces]
Mermaid Man: [turns it off] No, no! Prolonged exposure to the Orb of Confusion will give you... uh... confusion!
Patrick: [opens the boat's door] What about the Invisible Boatmobile?
Barnacle Boy: Especially not the Invisible Boatmobile! [closes the boat's door] When we say don't touch anything, we mean don't touch anything! Do you understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Loud and clear, trusted boy companion!
Barnacle Boy: Well, great. Here are the keys. [SpongeBob takes the key from his hand] We'll see you in a week.
Mermaid Man: [both run out the door] Up, up, and away!
SpongeBob: Come, BoyPatrick, while our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay! [both flip into the other room while letting out battle cries]
Patrick: Huh? MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA...
SpongeBob: What is it, trusted sidekick?
Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!
SpongeBob and Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! Man Ray! Aaaaaaaahhh! [both hide]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?
SpongeBob: Looks like he's frozen or something.
Patrick: FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO...
SpongeBob: It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... [licks the chamber] ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible! Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him! [Patrick pulls the lever down to UNFREEZE] Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!
Patrick: But you said you had a question.
SpongeBob: We could get in trouble!
Patrick: Well, that's not a question. [they both argue when Man Ray's eyes start to light up]
SpongeBob: They said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! [pulls level up back to FREEZE]
Man Ray: I'm free! Hahaha!
SpongeBob: Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
Man Ray: By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once!
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.
Man Ray: Why... NOT?!
SpongeBob: Because you're evil!
Man Ray: You mean, if I was good, then you'd let me go?
SpongeBob: Yeah, sure, why not?
Man Ray: Then, uh, in that case... I am good.
SpongeBob: Really?
Man Ray: Yes, really.
SpongeBob: Really, really?
Man Ray: Yes, yes, really, really.
SpongeBob: Really, really, really?
Man Ray: Yes, yes, already! I'm good! I'm good! Now let me out of here or you'll suffer dire consequences!
SpongeBob: Well, that's good enough for me. [SpongeBob pulls the lever back to "UNFREEZE" Man Ray is unfrozen and falls to the ground]
Man Ray: You fools! Prepare to be eradicated! [tries to jump at SpongeBob and Patrick but stops in mid-air and falls to the ground then laughs] What's wrong with me? Hahaha! What is this...Hahaha...infernal contraption?!
SpongeBob: Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17!
Narrator: [showing a picture of the belt] As seen in episode #17!
Patrick: Oh, I love that episode.
SpongeBob: Oh, me too, me too!
Man Ray: I'll never get out of here wearing this belt! [chuckles] I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me. [chuckles again] Time for those acting lessons to pay off.
SpongeBob: Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
Man Ray: Oh, boohoo! Oh, sob! Oh, cry! [opens and closes his eyes] Oh, woe is me! You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
SpongeBob: We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go!
Man Ray: [turns around] Ahh, that would be fantastic! [chuckles] I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready for your first day at goodness school? [Man Ray puts an apple on his desk] Pat, get your wallet out. [Patrick gets his wallet out of his pocket] Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. [Patrick tosses it on the ground] Now, what do you do?
Man Ray: Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.
Patrick: Doesn't look familiar to me.
Man Ray: What? I just saw you drop it. Here.
Patrick: Nope, it's not mine.
Man Ray: It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.
Patrick: Return what to who?
Man Ray: [facepalms, then shows Patrick his ID] Aren't you Patrick Star?
Patrick: Yup.
Man Ray: And this is your ID.
Patrick: Yup.
Man Ray: I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.
Patrick: That makes sense to me.
Man Ray: Then take it.
Patrick: It's not my wallet.
Man Ray: [in anger and frustration] You dim bulb! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off! [SpongeBob pushes tickle button and Man Ray laughs]
SpongeBob: Ah-ah! Wrong. [SpongeBob pushes button] Good people don't rip other people's arms off! [Man Ray chuckles] Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?
Man Ray: Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help with... [Patrick drops package on Man Ray's foot] Ow!
Patrick: Oops, sorry. Can I start over?
Man Ray: I noticed you was... [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Patrick: Oops! Gotta start again.
Man Ray: Would, [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Patrick: Oops!
Man Ray: [Growls in anger] You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?
Patrick: My wallets.
Man Ray: [Screams in fury. He grabs Patrick's head]
Patrick: No! SpongeBob, tickle him! [Man Ray slams Patrick into the ground. SpongeBob presses the tickle button]
Man Ray: [laughs] It tickles, but it's worth it! [continues slamming Patrick into the ground, while still laughing]
SpongeBob: Alright, goodness lesson number three. [Patrick is shown angry and severely injured] Uhh, let's see. [Patrick grabs the remote]
Patrick: I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
Man Ray: Umm... 62?
Patrick: Wrong! [pushes button]
Man Ray: Haha! Stop!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
Patrick: Let go of it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad!
Patrick: Let go!
SpongeBob: No, you let go!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Let... GO! [remote breaks and the belt goes hay-wire]
Man Ray: Frequency rising! Belt out of control! Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Belt on too hard! [he continues to laugh] It's tickling my DNA! Make it stop! [tears come out as he laughs] Haha! Please!
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
Patrick: Peanuts?
SpongeBob: No. Please.
Patrick: Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.
SpongeBob: Rehabilitated.
Patrick: Gesundheit.
SpongeBob: It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. [unlocks the belt, then the tickling stops] Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. [Man Ray takes the Aqua-Glove off the wall of weapons] Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. [Man Ray put the glove on his hand and activates it] We're not supposed to touch that, either. [Man Ray grabs the Cosmic-Ray and attaches it on the Aqua-Glove] We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. [He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick] Good people have no use for weapons such as... [Man Ray zaps them into dust] THOOOOSE!
Man Ray: [laughs] The only thing I'm good at is being evil. [door opens and Man Ray runs] So long, suckers!
Patrick: What's that smell, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
Patrick: Good, I thought it was my skin.
SpongeBob: Forget about your skin, Patrick! Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man...
Patrick: ...and Barnacle Boy! [both slide down the poles and get their costumes on]
SpongeBob: To the Invisible Boatmobile! [both stop in the invisible boat]
Patrick: Ignition, on!
SpongeBob: Wait! I don't have a license!
Patrick: Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. [shapes hand into a rectangle]
SpongeBob: You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. [they scream as the boat rams through the wall and into a street light]
Patrick: Thank goodness for invisible seat belts!
Man Ray: Out of my way, fools! You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to Man Ray!
SpongeBob: Not so fast, arch-villain! We still have the Orb of Confusion! [Patrick takes out the Orb of Confusion] Take this! [turns it on and gets all confused] Doy... Duh...
Man Ray: Well, that was easy. [heads to the bank where he kicks in the door] Hahaha! All right, people! Everybody stand right where you are!
[citizens gasp]
Man Ray: I want you to, uh... [Man Ray chuckles, so everyone else chuckles, too] No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to... [chuckles again, so everyone else is still chuckling] STOP LAUGHING, YOU FOOLS!
Bank Lady: What can I do for you, sir?
Man Ray: I'll tell you what you can do! [points glove at the lady] Gimme all of your... [Man Ray chuckles again] G-gimme, gimme all of your... [Man Ray is still chuckling] Give me...! [he chuckles so much he realizes what's going on] Aah! The belt is gone, but I still feel its tickle! The urge to do bad is gone! [sighs] I guess I'll just open a checking account. [Man Ray returns to SpongeBob and Patrick and turns the Orb of Confusion off]
SpongeBob: Doy... [gasps] Man Ray!
Man Ray: No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them! [Man Ray takes his head off and gives it to SpongeBob] I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder. [walks off] 
SpongeBob: Bye, Man Ray! Wow, we did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We saved the day! Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: Uhh... [still has a confused look on his face]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Woo-hoo? Patrick?
Sandy: [looking at the clouds] You know, SpongeBob, sometimes, it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by.
SpongeBob: Yup, and just relax.
Sandy: Yeah. Relax.
SpongeBob: Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
Sandy: What?
SpongeBob: A flower.
Sandy: They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.
SpongeBob: They sure do.
Sandy: You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.
SpongeBob: Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
Sandy: Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
SpongeBob and Sandy: [both laugh] Me.
SpongeBob: That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.
Sandy: Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See? [points to her acorn patch]
SpongeBob: I thought that meant you were nuts.
Sandy: Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength! [his fingers flex] What do you say to that, "Miss Mittens"?
Sandy: I'd say I'm already halfway there!
SpongeBob: Aaaaah! [begins to climb the mountain] No fair, Sandy! You got a head start!
Sandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles! [collapses the rock SpongeBob is climbing on]
SpongeBob: Hey! [gets back on another rock] You did that on purpose!
Sandy: Yeah, but this is an accident! [unleashes more rocks at him]
SpongeBob: [screams] Aaaaah!
Sandy: Too bad you forgot your umbrella!
SpongeBob: [holds on to an umbrella and floats up] ♪ I didn't! ♪ [laughing, reaches the top of the cliff]
Sandy: [sitting in a lounge chair, reading a newspaper] Well, it's about time you showed up.
SpongeBob: But you were... I saw you by the... I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
Sandy: Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.
SpongeBob: I can underwater! I'm... [Low voice] Hydrodynamically designed! [Normal voice] Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
Sandy: Why don't you ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you say to that, HydroPants?
SpongeBob: I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there! [zooms out to reveal a record player] -halfway there!-halfway there!
Sandy: [gasps] Hey!
SpongeBob: [running at the bottom of the mountain, laughing, hits a brick wall]
Sandy: [jumps on SpongeBob's face and over the brick wall] Thanks for the face lift! [runs into the Krusty Krab, laughing] You see? I told ya you didn't have a chan-
SpongeBob: [dressed as an old man] There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature [licks lips] waiting! [rips off suit, laughing]
Sandy: I thought y'all wanted a rematch.
SpongeBob: I did! And I took a head start like you did!
Sandy: Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!
SpongeBob: I guess we don't, air breather!
Sandy: Water sucker!
SpongeBob: Tree climber!
Sandy: Gulf streamer!
SpongeBob: Kite flier!
Sandy: Chum chewer!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Take that back! You- [nervously] not wet person!
Sandy: Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!
SpongeBob: Proves what?
Sandy: That land critters are better than sea critters!
Patrick: [walks to the two] Better at what?
Sandy Cheeks: Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!
Squidward: [walks to the three] What's she blabbering about?
Patrick: She says land creatures are best.
Sandy: Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur styling and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking [Mr. Krabs joins the four] and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs all gasp]
Sandy: And name calling, for sure!
Squidward: And drowning, don't forget drowning!
SpongeBob: [laughing] Good one, Squidward! [jumps to high five Squidward, but freezes in midair] Woo!
Squidward: Not on your life, sport. [SpongeBob falls]
SpongeBob: I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. [SpongeBob and the rest except Sandy start laughing until SpongeBob signals them to stop] But you're still just a land creature.
Sandy: Squirrels can do anything they want to!
Patrick: I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite. [gulps a big patty down] Ah.
Sandy: [reaches offscreen for the same big patty] Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing. [tries to eat it, but it splatters on her air helmet. Everyone, but Sandy, begins to laugh]
Patrick: Thank you, thank you.
Sandy: Well, that's just one thing.
Mr. Krabs: Can you do this? [pops his eyestalks in and out of his head] Everyone in my family can do that.
Sandy: [Tries to do it] Uh...uh...
Squidward: How about this? [balances six spinning plates on a stick with his tentacles] Huh?
SpongeBob: Can you reproduce by budding? [begins to do it] Can ya? Can ya? Huh? Can ya?
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: Most importantly...can you do this? [all except Sandy make their eyes big and round, and begin gasping three times without releasing any breath]
Sandy: Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?
SpongeBob: Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if it wasn't for that suit, you couldn't even live down here! [everyone but Sandy starts laughing]
Sandy: Well, you don't... [all continue laughing] I don't need to... [all laughing harder] Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit! [rips off suit, and all gasp] And I don't need this helmet neither! [throws helmet to ground, releasing an air bubble]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune preserve her!
Squidward: How long can she stay like that?
SpongeBob: I don't know!
Patrick: Sandy's a girl?
SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe... [he, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs chuckle while Sandy winks] Yep, won't be long now. [she starts struggling to hold her breath] Feelin' light-headed yet?
Sandy: Mm-mm. [Sandy shakes her head]
SpongeBob: Remember this? [SpongeBob takes a deep breath in and out]
Mr. Krabs: It's free! [also takes a deep breath in and out]
Sandy: [Starts suffocating underwater. Screen shows her insides where her lungs shrivel and her left lung breaks and falls off. She suffocates, looks around, runs to the counter, and quickly digs through multiple objects, then puts her head into a pickle jar and breathes heavily. All the others start laughing] Stop laughing at me!
Mr. Krabs: I knew it! There was no way some "airhead" was gonna win anything against a water breather!
Patrick: Airhead... [laughs. The top of his head deflates like a balloon] Huh? [puts thumb in mouth and blows. His head becomes round at the top]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!
Sandy: All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!
Squidward: Do we have to wear pickle jars? [All, except Sandy, laugh]
Sandy: Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.
SpongeBob: One minute? No problem, Landy! [All but Sandy begin to laugh]
Sandy: [all but her are still laughing, as she leads them all to an island rising out of the water from the seafloor, as they see the island, they stop laughing] Well? So are you going or not?
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stammering] Uh, well, uh, uh, um...
SpongeBob: Actually, you know, but...
Squidward: We can't, uh...because...
Mr. Krabs: We're late for, um...
Patrick: Our fitting!
Sandy: Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes?
Patrick: [holding and eating popcorn] Hey! We are not chicken! [drops popcorn] Huh! My popcorn! [begins pecking at it like a chicken]
SpongeBob: Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. [looks at the water's surface and pokes his finger above the water] There. Mission accomplished.
Sandy: Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!
SpongeBob: No way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!
Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: We're not afraid of your dumb old land!
Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: We're sea creatures!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Okay... Well, this is it.
Mr. Krabs: Wait, boy! [gives him a glass of water] Make it last.
SpongeBob: [drinks from it] Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay, here I go! [gasps out of water, He's now a real yellow kitchen sponge on a stick] Hey, this isn't so bad! We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!
Patrick: I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball! [jumps up out of the water. He's now a real pink starfish, missing his pants, on a stick] Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here!
Mr. Krabs: All ashore that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho! [runs up. he is a red rubber toy crab on a stick]
SpongeBob: Looking good, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo!
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, you're missing all the dry. Come on, Squidward!
SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs: [chanting] Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it. [walks up. he's a puppet octopus with his eyes and big nose. [all stop chanting] ...What?
SpongeBob: Well, here we are. [all four are walking on the island]
Squidward: This is pretty easy.
Patrick: I may keep a second rock up here!
Mr. Krabs: Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad!
SpongeBob: We're the masters of land and sea! [a string puppet seagull lands in front of them] Hey, it’s a local! Hi, we're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? [seagull looks at screen]
Sandy: 3, 2, 1. Well, tan my fur. They made it! Better go congratulate 'em. [walks onto the island. She's now a real plush squirrel toy with a small, round plastic helmet on her head] SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to? [sees the seagulls attacking all four of them] Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! Hiyah! [attacks the birds and feathers start flying. All five sink back down to the seabed, with Squidward upside-down.]
SpongeBob: Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy.
Sandy: You know, everyone's best at something.
SpongeBob: But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy.
Sandy: Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
All: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
All: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
Seagulls: [lying injured on the island with their feathers missing] Hooray.
Narrator: Ahoy, kids. It's time for SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special!
Pirates: Hooray!
Narrator: And now the host of You Wish. He's got puffier pantaloons than Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair than Black Beard. He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino!
Patchy: [opens the door] Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. (walks inside, and to the kitchen) It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if you're technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-
Potty: Bawk! In what way?
Patchy: Well, If it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
Potty: Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Patchy: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh... [Potty flies away] Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go? [enters something] Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?
[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window]
Potty: [laughs and squawking] Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.
Patchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Now, what was I saying? (Patchy walks to his desk with so many phones and sits down) Now, this cartoon ain't like most of your "land-lobbing cartoons". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to, call the number that's scrolling down there at the bottom of the screen: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com. ["1 (800) 624-4094" appears on the bottom of the screen (in <a href="wikiThe_First_100_Episodes" title="The First 100 Episodes">the First 100 Episodes<a> version it says "Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!" instead). Phone starts ringing. Patchy picks up phone] No, not now! Don't call 'til I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because- [More phones start to ring] You're not gonna make this easy, are ya? Quiet! I'm not there! Belate that ringing! Stop! Its driving me mad!
SpongeBob: Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time. [Gary's pupils dilate] Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way, [zooms in on Gary's eyes] or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way... [Gary just stares] So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
SpongeBob: Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch! [Throws the ball to Gary. Toy boomerangs back to SpongeBob and he reads the box] Huh? "New" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm. [throws the box but it boomerangs back and hits SpongeBob in the head]
SpongeBob: [with a bomb strapped to his chest] Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!... [Gary doesn't react] ...Please... [bomb explodes] ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.
[pictures of a bathtub, a shower faucet running, and then a bar of soap come up, then a disturbing picture of a giggling girl appears]
Subliminal Girl: [high-pitched laugh]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry you had to see that. [on the phone] Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath. [person on the other side is talking] What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language! [hangs up] Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn. [flips Gary into the wall and breaks his shell, then we see Gary with his shell bandaged] Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog? [Gary whacks him on the head with a cane] ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house! [Mr. Krabs comes in taking a bath then takes SpongeBob's dollar] Ya-da-da-da... [stops dancing] That didn't work either, huh? [SpongeBob dresses as a pirate] Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen... [nervously looks at Gary] 40. The treasure must be in here! [opens bathroom door] Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub. [Kicks away a paint can] It's treasure. Look, doubloons. [shows 2 bars of soap] Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch! [shows a rubber ducky]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is on SpongeBob] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub!! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub... [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub. [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but he floats over the tub, and appears back on the floor after 2 seconds] Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to... [pulls up Gary off the floor but both end up dangling from the ceiling] Gary, could you... [Gary sucks in one of his eyes into his head and SpongeBob loses his grip] Gary, no! [Gary pulls in other eye] Gary! [SpongeBob falls in the tub]. Alright, Gary, you have duped, andor, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. [absorbs all the water in the bathtub]. Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. [SpongeBob spits water at Gary but misses and hits the armchair instead]. Come back, Gary. I have something to "chair" with you. [SpongeBob spits more water at Gary but misses and hits dirty dishes, which cleans and stacks them] "Dishes" more like it. "Water" you waiting for, Gary?
Gary: [meowing in a tree]
SpongeBob: Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. [spits out water at Gary but realizes it's a gramophone playing a record of Gary's meows]. Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin. [Gary, while meowing mockingly, takes the ladder off the tree] Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant. [ladder falls down] I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I am so the boss of you!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say. [Gary slithers forward] What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister. [Gary stops right next to some mud] Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary, the snail, do you hear me? I am giving you three seconds to get away from that mud puddle. One, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two and a half... [Gary leans over the mud] don't make me say three! [Gary leans further over the mud] Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!! [SpongeBob falls out of the tree and into the mud] I'm a dirty boy. [SpongeBob is in the bathtub]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, Gary. [scrubs his ears] I'm getting behind my ears. [Gary grins]
French Narrator: Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck.
Artist: Hmm... ah! [He kisses his pencil, then he draws some more strokes. He hums something. He accidentally throws his pencil into the sea. It sinks in the water until it's out of sight]
Artist: My pencil! [searches for it in the sea] What? No, no!
French Narrator: The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil.
Artist: Noooooo! [with a loudly sound. Cut to the pencil dropping into the water. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with bubbles]
SpongeBob: Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...
Patrick: Two...
Both: Three!
[SpongeBob blows a scissors bubble and Patrick blows a paper bubble]
SpongeBob: Scissors beats paper, Patrick! [they both laugh at that] One...
Both: two...
SpongeBob: Three! [both blow paper bubbles] Patrick, how come you always do paper? [the pencil pops the two paper bubbles and drops in the sand and the two scream]
Patrick: What is that thing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It looks like a giant pencil.
Patrick: Go touch it.
[SpongeBob extends his arm and touches the pencil]
SpongeBob: It is a giant pencil, Patrick! [SpongeBob grabs the pencil] Let's draw some giant pictures with it.
Patrick: Whatcha drawin'?
SpongeBob: Stand back, Patrick! I can't draw with you breathing down my neck!
Patrick: Psh, artists.
SpongeBob: It's a jellyfish.
Patrick: Pretty good, SpongeBob! But it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.
SpongeBob: Eh, everybody's a critic.
[The drawing comes to life and swims away buzzing]
Patrick: SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!
SpongeBob: Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic!
Patrick: No, I mean it's swimming away!
SpongeBob: Do you know what this means, Patrick?
Patrick: Your art can never hang in a museum.
SpongeBob: It means we found a magic pencil!
Patrick: Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Coming right up! [he draws mustache on Patrick's face]
Patrick: Life is good! [the mustache floats away. He shrugs] Easy come, easy go.
Squidward: Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea! You've got looks... talent... all you need is a full head of... [the mustache goes on his head] hair!
Patrick: My turn!
SpongeBob: Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.
Patrick: Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.
SpongeBob: Okay! Why didn't you say so?
[Patrick draws a crudely-drawn picture of Squidward with a small stature and a waving fist.]
SpongeBob: Hey! Another jellyfish!
Patrick: It's Squidward, silly!
[The badly drawn Squidward comes to life and grumbles at them]
SpongeBob: It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.
Patrick: You're right, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: We can't let it go into town! [Patrick erases it]
Patrick: Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hey! My brain just hatched an idea. [he draws a dollar on Squidward's green mat, attached to a string while laughing] This is gonna be classic!
Squidward: [dressed up] I think I fancy a stroll around the park.
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: [opens door] What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy! [SpongeBob pulls the string] Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair! [it floats away] SpongeBob!
[Squidward goes back inside and slams the door, Patrick and SpongeBob hop up and down and suddenly stop.]
SpongeBob: Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me! [SpongeBob draws a doodle of himself, Patrick laughs. The drawing stands up] Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie. [Draws it] Ready for action! 
[The SpongeBob doodle shouts nonsense and he runs over to Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Patrick: He's going to the door.
[DoodleBob knocks on the door.]
SpongeBob: He's knocking on the door. Squidward's answering the door and...
[DoodleBob picks up Squidward, holding him upside-down and repeatedly pounds his head on the ground]
Squidward: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Patrick: He's beating up Squidward! Ha! Ha! Ha!
[Patrick and SpongeBob watch DoodleBob slam Squidward back and forth.]
SpongeBob: DoodleBoy, stop! [DoodleBob throws Squidward back in his house. Then he steals the magic pencil and then runs away with it]
Patrick: He's got the pencil.
SpongeBob: What have I done? We've got to find him!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick in a field with tall bushes] 
SpongeBob: Where could he possibly be?
Patrick: Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.
SpongeBob: Come on, let's go! [Patrick hides in a bush]
Patrick: I'm not going in there [SpongeBob also hides]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there... [DoodleBob draws a hole. They fall into it]
Patrick: What just happened?
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense] Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!
Patrick: Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?
SpongeBob: No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him. [a giant wrench falls and hits Patrick on the head]
DoodleBob: Neofineyin!
SpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick?
Patrick: [dizzily] Where's the leak, ma'am? [DoodleBob draws a bowling ball and rolls it. Patrick's head turns into a bowling pin in surprise] Yurrgh! [Hits Patrick and some pink bowling pins and a "strike" symbol appears. Another "strike" symbol then appears after the bowling ball falls into the hole.]
SpongeBob: You okay, Patrick?
Patrick: Finland!
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense and more nonsense] Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay! [he runs off in the distance, Bubble transition to a coral rock wall and a field]
SpongeBob: There he is.
Patrick: He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!
SpongeBob: Ahem.
Patrick: [blushes] Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob! Heh heh.
SpongeBob: He's putting down the pencil! This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him!
Patrick: Oh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?
[DoodleBob breaks through the coral rock wall where SpongeBob and Patrick are hiding behind.]
DoodleBob: [nonsense] Bawahh bwah bwah wahh! [DoodleBob grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick! Do something!
Patrick: Happy birthday!
[DoodleBob throws SpongeBob, who screams and lands with a thud in the distance]
Patrick: [Gives DoodleBob a rock] Here's your present. [DoodleBob bashes it on his head] You're welcome.
DoodleBob: [nonsense] Dewaaagheaugaaagh! [DoodleBob was about to run for his life until SpongeBob stops him whilst holding the pencil in his face]
SpongeBob: Hold it right there, Doodle. I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense fast] Bee ha, bala hala ba ba!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, what was that?
DoodleBob: [Slowing gibberish down] Bee ha, bala hala ba ba. [DoodleBob starts to shout more gibberish while SpongeBob erases his face. DoodleBob mutters, then he hits a rock]
SpongeBob: Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good. [begins to erase DoodleBob to oblivion] Take that and this and this and that and this that this that... [he screams in victory] I am SpongeBob, destroyer of evil!
Patrick: Take it easy. It's just a drawing.
SpongeBob: [calmly] Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?
Patrick: Done and done.
[When SpongeBob and Patrick go home, it is soon revealed that one of DoodleBob's arms is still alive. It creeps out from under the rock. Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob had just returned home. He draws on the spaces of his bedroom to make it look like a fancy bedroom, complete with a canopy for his bed.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.
Gary: [with a crown on] Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, magic pencil. [Falls asleep. DoodleBob's arm goes into SpongeBob's house, it starts going up the stairs and takes a bathroom break, finally he sneaks up to SpongeBob's bed, grabs the pencil, and starts to re-draw himself. He wakes up] Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water? [laughs] [DoodleBob pops up in his bed; SpongeBob screams] DoodleBob! [slightly chuckles] No hard feelings, right? [DoodleBob draws two angry eyebrows on his face and jumps on SpongeBob's bed holding the pencil threateningly] [screams] What do you think you're doing, doodle?!
DoodleBob: You Doodle! Me SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams and jump out of the ways as DoodleBob erases his pillow, then part of SpongeBob's house whilst chasing him, they chase downstairs. DoodleBob erases a door and the back of SpongeBob's pants, revealing his butt] Huh? [Erases his butt]
SpongeBob: [screams] Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen? [DoodleBob erases his nose] I nose. [DoodleBob erases some parts of his face and body, DoodleBob laughs at the way he looks now] Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn. [When SpongeBob and DoodleBob struggle, the pencil breaks into two. SpongeBob has the lead and draws the rest of his face and body back] Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw. [DoodleBob sharpens the pencil with his mouth. He now has both sides] You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school. [the lead piece flies out of his hand, crashes through the window and hits Squidward]
Squidward: [offscreen] Ouch! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!
SpongeBob: Or maybe it was most clumsy. [DoodleBob starts to attack him again as SpongeBob hides in a bookshelf, as DoodleBob approaches him, he gets his foot stuck in a piece of paper on the floor, DoodleBob sees this and tries to get it off] Huh? [SpongeBob looks in a book] Paper! [DoodleBob tosses the pencil from his hand] Page for Mr. Doodle! [Smashes him with a notebook. SpongeBob watches as DoodleBob is preserved as a drawing, when it was all over, he smiles. The next day, SpongeBob hangs the piece of paper on the wall with a push-pin]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?
SpongeBob: Take a look for yourself, Patrick.
Patrick: [Gasp!] It's the evil Doodle!
SpongeBob: No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose. [he blows from a pipe]
Patrick: So... he's a drawing?
SpongeBob: Exactly! See how happy he is?
Patrick: [He looks at the paper with DoodleBob on it] He still looks kind of creepy.
[Cut to outside. SpongeBob has just drawn a diving board. The pencil's broken halves have recently been taped together.]
SpongeBob: O, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready! [SpongeBob drops the pencil into Patrick's mouth. SpongeBob jumps from the diving board and onto Patrick's chest, and the pencil is launched back to the surface. In the real world, the artist from earlier is curled up in a fetal position]
French Narrator: We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.
Artist: [the pencil reaches the surface and lands on him] Huh? What's this? [he jumps up and holds his pencil in joy] My pencil! [he tries to draw, but unfortunately, the pencil lead breaks]
French Narrator: [As the artist starts to cry] The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener.
Artist: Noooooo!
SpongeBob: [as he runs to Patrick's rock] Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? [Patrick comes out of his rock with a box, doing an acrobatic trick]
Patrick: Oh, boy, am I!
SpongeBob: Here's your net. [Patrick glances at his box] Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.
Patrick: First, I have to put away my secret box.
SpongeBob: Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! [SpongeBob tries to peek in the box, but Patrick pulls it away]
Patrick: Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh! [opens the box, laughs at it, and shuts it as SpongeBob tries to peek it] Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life! [SpongeBob gets behind Patrick to see what's inside the box, but Patrick holds it to himself]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.
Patrick: You do?
SpongeBob: I've got a gazillion secrets!
Patrick: Like what?
SpongeBob: Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. [Patrick drools as the top of his head has lightning bolts coming out of it, showing that he couldn't understand the whole sentence]
SpongeBob: You wanna hear one of my secrets?
Patrick: Do I?
SpongeBob: Uhh... Let's see... [he runs up to Patrick] Did you know that you're my best friend? [he runs away]
Patrick: No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!
SpongeBob: Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.
Patrick: Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh. [SpongeBob clears his throat and taps on Patrick's box] Tell me some more secrets!
SpongeBob: Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think jellyfishing and bubble-blowing are the... [transition to SpongeBob still telling secrets as Patrick lays his head on the box] ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word "fancy" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now. [he shows his three pairs of underwear to Patrick]
Patrick: Gasp. I never would have guessed.
SpongeBob: Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. [Patrick imagines a carton of milk spilling itself]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh… [close-up of SpongeBob's socks] I've got my secret socks on. [he runs away and comes back with Gary's bowl] And my secret Gary's bowl! [he runs away then comes back, pulling his television] My secret TV! [turns on the TV] And my secret TV channel. [the TV shows an off-air color bars screen] What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: [he giggles, then laughs loudly after a gander at the box and then stops to breathe. He looks again and laughs harder and wildly. He stops to breathe] Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret. [he shows the box to SpongeBob] Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box. [SpongeBob tries to peek inside the box, but Patrick slams it shut] Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house. [scene zooms out to show Squidward's Tiki Head home looking down at SpongeBob and Patrick, who notice the looks before it goes back to normal] It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna… [gasps when he finds out his box is gone, The scene cuts to a laughing SpongeBob running with Patrick's secret box, but then he bumps into Patrick's belly] SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!
SpongeBob: [Struggles with Patrick on the box]But, Patrick, I must know the secret!
Patrick: [Struggles with SpongeBob on the box]For the last time, SpongeBob, no!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, just a peek?
Patrick: Never! [SpongeBob and Patrick strain as they fight over the box. Eventually, SpongeBob's arms pop off and he gasps] So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club! [he shows his finger with the ring on it and then the camera zooms in on the ring. He grabs one of SpongeBob's arms and points it at SpongeBob] Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants! [as he pokes SpongeBob's nose with his arm] If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!
SpongeBob: But... we're supposed to be... [his eyes get big and sad] friends forever. [flashback to SpongeBob and Patrick as babies in a crib laughing, then we see them as kids riding on a bike, then as they are now, riding a bike, then as older men in rocking chairs, then we see a shot of two gravestones with their names and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick still laughing, but they are buried. The flashback ends.] I feel so filthy! [he starts to cry] I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself! [he jumps on Patrick] I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!
Patrick: Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever? [we see a close-up of Patrick's box] The most amazing... [as he sticks the box in SpongeBob's eyes, the eyes pop out of him and then back in] mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. [he eyes are glued to the box for a moment, and then goes back to him]
SpongeBob: So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?
Patrick: Friends. [they shake hands. Cuts to a night view of SpongeBob's house, then inside as SpongeBob talks]
SpongeBob: What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish! [he slides down in his bed] Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds. [he sits up] Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box. [he hides himself in the blanket and shivers] Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party! [screams, then jumps onto the bedroom window and talks a little muffled] I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do! [SpongeBob's face pops off and sticks onto his back] That's it! How do you look in a secret box? [he jumps off the window] Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back. [he turns around to show only his nose. He turns back around] Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary? [Gary narrows his eyes]
Gary: Meeh… No. [cut to the outside]
SpongeBob: Oh, what do you know? You're a snail! [SpongeBob sneaks to Patrick's house, puts gloves and a ski mask on him, crawls up the rock with his back, and tears him in half and gets both halves under the rock. He then lands and notices Patrick. He then screams gibberish, drools and SpongeBob hides behind the portrait of SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob then peeks and then the wall starts to crack. Patrick mumbles, the wall breaks even more and then the nail falls off. He then grabs the nail with his foot and puts it back.]
Patrick: [as the camera zooms in on the box] Seee... cret.
SpongeBob: [thinking] I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. [slides down the wall from the portrait and makes a loud noise upon touching the floor. Patrick stretches and then goes back to sleep. SpongeBob then lifts his leg and then Patrick makes another noise. He then tosses himself over on the bed. SpongeBob puts his leg down, which makes a loud noise]
Patrick: Duh... who's there? [he mumbles then goes back to sleep.]
SpongeBob: [talking to his foot] Shhh! [SpongeBob steps on a potato chip and makes a broken glass sound]
Patrick: Eh?! [gibberish] Who's that?! [Patrick is back asleep. SpongeBob sweeps his sweat drops off him and they land, causing a loud splash sound.] Mmm... water. [he licks his mouth dry, then tosses himself on the bed. SpongeBob takes another step and makes an "AWOOOOGA!" noise. He then steps again, making a loud machine gun noise. Steps again, making the sound of an elephant. He then stretches his leg near the side of the bed, then takes the step, making a very loud crashing noise. He then peeks above Patrick to see the box. He gets ready to reach for the box, but Patrick takes the box before SpongeBob could grab it. He then slides onto Patrick, grabbing the box] Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside. [opens SpongeBob's mouth and pulls out his tongue, then laughs. He lets go of his tongue] Nighty-night, boxie. [he puts SpongeBob on the side of the bed. SpongeBob gets off the bed and then trips on a shoestring, causing him to bounce around Patrick's house, making a lot of loud noises until his head hits the wall, causing the portrait to fall off the wall, hitting him in the head, breaking the portrait half. The box then lands on SpongeBob and makes a loud noise. The scene cuts back to Patrick, who, despite all the noise, continues to sleep]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. [Patrick wakes up]
Patrick: Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!
SpongeBob: Uh…
Patrick: It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box! [he runs up to SpongeBob] Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life! [he cocks his pillow like a shotgun]
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! [takes off his mask] It's me, SpongeBob!
Patrick: [stares at him while clueless] Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.
SpongeBob: No, really, Patrick! Look! [Patrick gasps. SpongeBob presses a button on the ring]
SpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring: It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!
Patrick: Our friendship ring! It is you! [crying as he covers his face with his pillow] How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?
SpongeBob: If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. [he throws the pillow away and snatches the box out of SpongeBob's hands]
Patrick: [with a tear coming out of his eye] That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over!
SpongeBob: [gasps and tears up] Really?
Patrick: Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.
SpongeBob: Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes! [he lifts the lid off the box] Huh?
Patrick: Well, didn't I tell ya? [we see a string inside the box] Isn't it great?
SpongeBob: It's just a string.
Patrick: A secret string!
SpongeBob: Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that! [he puts the lid back on the box] Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!
Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob pops out of Patrick's house]
SpongeBob: I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along! [he laughs] Wait 'till I tell Gary!
Patrick: [laughs menacingly] Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the... [a secret compartment opens] ...secret compartment of my secret box... [he takes out a photo] ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party! [cut to the Bikini Atoll] Merry Christmas, SpongeBob! [laughs as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]
French narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about...
Squidward: [talks cheerfully as he switches the “Open” sign to "Closed"] Now! 8:00! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is: [pulls out his clarinet] Clarinet. [Tom shows up at the door and knocks on it, causing Squidward to drop his clarinet] What?
Tom: Are you open?
Squidward: [points to the sign] Read the sign.
Tom: [ignores him] I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a double chili kelp fries.
Squidward: No, you won't! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.
Tom: Well, fine, if you don't want my money!
Mr. Krabs: [says cheerfully] Money?! [Mr. Krabs then falls from the ceiling on top of Squidward] You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?
Tom: [pulls out cash; Sadie, an anchovy, and an old man appear behind him] Sure!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, [tears up the “Closed” sign] welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.
Squidward: What!? [crowd of fish barge in cheering]
SpongeBob: Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs..
Mr. Krabs: See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life. [leaves]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working! [gasps] It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease! [jumps on cash register counter] Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
Squidward: [Sandals walks up to counter; Squidward hands him a baseball bat] Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.
SpongeBob: Pst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen [laughs] at night!
Squidward: [takes hat off; leans head on counter] Don't hold back.
SpongeBob: [cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen] Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob in the bathroom wiping it clean with himself] Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob at the grill picking up spatula, misses the spatula and hits the grill; screams] I burned my hand!...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob walking on the counter, singing to the tune of Charge] Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!
Squidward: Will you please?! Here, [hands SpongeBob a bag of garbage] give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!
SpongeBob: All right! [takes bag from Squidward] Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night. [stops at the door] You mean outside?
Squidward: That's where the dumpster is, yes.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward, [leans face against window] it's kinda dark out there.
Squidward: But I thought you liked the night shift.
SpongeBob: You're right! [lifts bag over his head] For the Krusty Krab! [runs out of the building to the dumpster, screaming and panicking the whole way; reenters the building panting heavily. He snaps his fingers and confidently says] Piece of cake!
Squidward: So you're not afraid?
SpongeBob: Pfft, nah.
Squidward: Well I am. Especially after, [looks around, gulps] well, you know.
SpongeBob: [turns around] What? What do I know?
Squidward: You don't remember? It was all over the news.
SpongeBob: Tell me, tell me!
Squidward: No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. [gives a sympathetic look, then smiles slyly]
SpongeBob: [excitedly] What happened, what happened, what happened!?
Squidward: You mean you've never heard the story of the [thinks] "Hash-Slinging Slasher?"
SpongeBob: The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
SpongeBob: The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
Squidward: Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha---[breaks into scream] because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!
SpongeBob: [begging] Tell me the story!
Squidward: Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.
SpongeBob: He forgot the secret sauce?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: He didn't wash his hands?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Irregular portions?
Squidward: No! He cut off his own hand by mistake.
SpongeBob: You mean like this? [pulls one of his arms out of socket, another one grows back in its place] Or like this? [pulls it again, another one grows back] Or this? [does it again] Or this? [does it again] But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or...
Squidward: [interrupts] Except he wasn't a sponge!
SpongeBob: [ask with all his extra hands creating a rainbow-like line] So?
Squidward: So it didn't grow back!
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh, no! [all his extra arms lift their hands upwards and run away]
Squidward: And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?
SpongeBob: Tuesday.
Squidward: Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.
SpongeBob: [gasps] But tonight's Tuesday night!
Squidward: Then he'll be coming.
SpongeBob: How will we know?
Squidward: There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next...
Harold: [interrupts] Dude, can I have some ketchup?
Squidward: Oh, here you go. [hands him ketchup] Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails] And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails, starts eating his arms, the arms regrow and he eats those and then he eats his arms like popcorn] Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead! [SpongeBob begins eating his hands like popcorn] Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand..
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: He opens the door [pushes his tentacle to SpongeBob's face, making it looking like he's a door that's being opened; while doing this he imitates the sound of a squeaky door opening. leans towards SpongeBob's face, which sinks in] He slowly approaches the counter ["counter" echoes menacingly] ...and you know what he does next?
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: You really want to know?
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Are you sure you want to know?
SpongeBob: What, what, what does he do?!
Squidward: [sneaks up on SpongeBob, taps him] He gets ya! [SpongeBob now screams repeatedly for about 20 seconds while Squidward is laughing] SpongeBob... [continues screaming] SpongeBob I wa... [screaming continues] I was ju... [SpongeBob's pupils are now screaming too] I was jus... [screaming continues] SpongeBob, I was joking!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: It's not true! None of it's true!
SpongeBob: It's not?
Squidward: Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
SpongeBob: Ohhhhh. [laughs repeatedly like he did with screaming] [cuts into later in the night. Shows Krusty Krab with a big sign that says 'Open Forever']
[Squidward is shown at the counter reading a book. Squidward hears spooky noises and feels water dripping on him but he doesn't know what it is.]
SpongeBob: [on the ceiling wearing suction cups cleaning] Isn't this great, Squidward? [Squidward screams] There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.
Squidward: [says to himself] Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
[cuts to Patrick's bedroom]
Patrick: [Patrick's alarm clock goes off] Oh, boy! Three A.M.! [whips out a Krabby Patty and starts to eat it; cuts back to The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here! [lights start to flicker on and off] Very funny, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: "And the lights will flicker on and off." Just like the story. I get it. [realizes no one is flickering the light switch and looks shocked]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?
Squidward: I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day! [phone rings, Squidward picks it up] What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: [walks up to the counter] Nice try, Squidward.
Squidward: Nice try, what?
SpongeBob: "The phone will ring and there will be no one there." [raises eyebrows up and down and giggles] Oh, you crack me up.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm not doing this. [hangs up phone] Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights, [lights flicker on and off] and the phone, [phone rings] and the walls will ooze green slime! [walls start to ooze green slime] No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? [hears a motor, turns his head and opens his eyes wide; a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab doors]
SpongeBob: [walks up to the counter] I didn't know the buses ran this late. 
Squidward: They don't! [a man gets out of the bus and the bus pulls away, all Squidward and SpongeBob can see is his spooky outline]
SpongeBob: Well, they're dropping someone off. [from the outside, the man lifts his spatula]
Squidward: [screams to the point where hair grows from his head and starts wiggling]
Squidward: The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...
SpongeBob: The Hash-Slinging Slasher! [starts to cry]
Squidward: At last you understand! We're doomed!
SpongeBob: No, that's not it. [wipes tear] I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me! [cries again]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!? [the man taps on the door with his spatula]
SpongeBob:  [screams to the point where his eyelashes grow and start wiggling]
SpongeBob and Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher! [the guy walks in the door and up to the counter]
Squidward: [screams]
SpongeBob: He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!
Squidward: SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!
Squidward: Huh? [a nerdy unnamed guy reaches the counter]
SpongeBob: Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!
Richard: Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula. [holds up spatula] I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.
SpongeBob: Do you have references?
Squidward: Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights? [lights flicker on and off; SpongeBob, Squidward, and Richard look over to see Nosferatu]
SpongeBob, Squidward and Richard: Nosferatu!
Nosferatu: [smiles, light turns off]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. [class groans]
SpongeBob: [leans towards Nat] Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
Mrs. Puff: Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. [class groans again]
SpongeBob: [again leaning towards Nat] Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
Mrs. Puff: In no less than 800 words! [squeals and class groans again]
Nat: [acting like SpongeBob] Did you hear that? 800 words!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know! [Nat frowns]
Mrs. Puff: Due tomorrow. And remember, class: work hard and no goofing off.
[back at SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is [holds up a pencil] the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. [kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it] Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. [looks at window, it's colorful outside] Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey, this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now, pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! [SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and has still only written 8 words] Gee, this is harder than I thought... [looks outside. There is a carnival. Squidward is suntanning. A boy is eating ice cream. Jellyfish are playing tennis. Gary is riding on a ball and playing a horn. Patrick is rubbing Sandy with sunscreen]
Patrick: Come on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob sinks back down out of sight of the window]
SpongeBob: It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! [a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up. Cut back to SpongeBob] Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only 6 o'clock! [cuts to SpongeBob's ticking clock, then back to SpongeBob at his desk] Okay, here we go, here we go. [SpongeBob struggles to write] Bah! I know! I just need to get a little blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? [does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites Hup Ho several times. His nose and eyelashes do the same thing.] I can feel those juices pumpin' now! [moves his chair closer to the table. He does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs] Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! [pushes his chair in] Come on, pencil, make words.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What do you mean you're not hungry?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary! [Grabs Gary by his shell and pours some food, he takes up a ladder and fills it to ceiling-level] I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. [Gary quickly eats it] Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? [steps in Garys food] Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. [cleans it up using himself as a mop] Hmmm...I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places, too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. [cut to SpongeBob, who has already finished] Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long...and it's only...10:00! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written! [Begins active writing] I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah...yeah...yeah! And some of these, and some of these...Almost there and...done. Now let’s see how it looks so far. "The-" [shows he has only written "the" in fancy lettering] Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go...think, SpongeBob, think! [looks at the telephone. Cut to Patrick in bed, snoring. The phone rings and he wakes up]
Patrick: Who is that? [picks up the phone] Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?
Patrick: Sleeping.
SpongeBob: That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss, I remember on the...
Patrick: SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.
SpongeBob: [gasps and stammers] That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!
Patrick: Well, I'm listening.
SpongeBob: Uh...Marco!
Patrick: Polo. [hangs up]
SpongeBob: Yeah, well I gotta get going, Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up the phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long, Pesky Particles! [they float back to SpongeBob, who chokes on one] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What do you mean 'overly dramatic?', Gary? All that choking sure made me hungry.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary, I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see...White or rye bread...or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese [doorbell rings] A visitor? For me!? [SpongeBob opens the door to meet a mailfish] Hello!
Mailfish: Package for Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Great, thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?
Mailfish: It puts bread on the table.
SpongeBob: Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs]
Maifish: Oh, brother..
SpongeBob: So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well, I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...
Mailfish: Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away]
SpongeBob: [gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blips his eyes and slides back into his house]
Johnny Elaine: In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. [head sticks out TV] When will he learn?
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. SpongeBob lights a candle]
Chair: Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat, put your feet up and relax.
SpongeBob: [gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up] Oh no! Midnight! [running in the hallway and the alarms ring on the walls] Must.. get... back to desk! [runs to the table, but it has enlarged. he jumps up on the chair] Whew, that was a close call. [his pants are missing] Ah! My pants!
Pants: Yoo hoo! Down here!
SpongeBob: You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
Pants: [runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door] Freedom!
SpongeBob: [runs out the door] Stop, Pants! You get back here this instant! Paaants...! [door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. He looks in the window. The candle is still lighting. The clock spins, breaks, and comes to life]
Clock: [ghostly voice] Time's up, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [gasps the candle melts] Burning!
Flame: Only 799 words to go! [laughs sinisterly and he burns essay and the inside of his pineapple burns]
SpongeBob: No! [as his house burns, he screams] What have I done?! [SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling] Help! Help! My house is on fire! [continues running around his burnt house until it comes to life]
House: SpongeBob, why?! Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob?! Why didn't you just write your essay?! [breathes loudly] Stop wasting time!
SpongeBob: [wakes up. It was only a nightmare] Huh!? Where's my essay? Oh, there you are! [laughs] I must have dozed off. [grabs his paper from his head] Let’s see, where are we? [holding his paper with a word "The" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock..? [gasps] It's almost 9:00! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes?! How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight... [writing] And... making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [cut to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?
Mrs. Puff: Oh, there you are, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em.
Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you.. I have to go to a teacher's convention!
SpongeBob: But what about my essay?
Mrs. Puff: I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!
[SpongeBob rips his essay. He then rips himself]
Squidward: Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image. [wife's head turns into Squidward's and the husband notices] And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!
Janitor: Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.
Squidward: Uncultured trash urchin. 9am. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer. [opens door] Welcome to art class!
French Narrator: Ahh, another peaceful evening in Bikini Bottom. Listen to the tropical tranquility. [we see the town of Bikini Bottom; something underground is tunneling and consumes the Bikini Bottom sign] Uh-oh. [the tunneling thing moves on to the rest of Bikini Bottom; a cop is writing a ticket for a car parked near a fire hydrant; the thing, still invisible, makes eating noises; we then see that the car has disappeared, so the cop picks up the fire hydrant, moves it to the adjacent car, and places the ticket on that car, whistling as he casually walks away; the thing moves on to SpongeBob's house; Gary wakes up, sees the thing, and meows in terror; SpongeBob is still fast asleep]
SpongeBob: [mumbling, half-asleep] Two soups, please. Thank you. [the thing takes SpongeBob's blanket] You keep the change. [the thing takes SpongeBob's pillow] What? [he wakes up fully and stares fixedly at the thing in terror; camera zooms out to show half of the pineapple house's walls missing; a new scene shows SpongeBob talking to the crowd at the Krusty Krab] I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!
Patrick: That's horrible! [gobbles down a whole tray of food, containers and all]
SpongeBob: It was an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! [each of the three words appears on screen; "Alaskan" in an icy form, "Bull" in a furry text, and "Worm!" with different worms forming the word. The crowd murmurs worriedly]
Fred: He ate my wheelbarrow! [he has his wheelbarrow with a bite taken out of it]
Nancy Suzy Fish: He ate my children's homework! [her two kids wink simultaneously and give a big thumbs-up]
Awesome FishFish 3: [has a huge bite taken out of his butt] Do I need to say it?
Fish 4: [crowd murmurs some more] How can we protect ourselves?
Mr. Krabs: I've got it! Let's all buy a Krabby Patty! [crowd boos and throws ketchup and mustard bottles at him]
Fish 5: We should lock our doors!
Mable: We should call my nephew!
Knight Fish: We should dig a moat!
Patrick: We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else! [crowd immediately quiets down]
Squidward: That idea may just be crazy enough... to get us all killed! [crowd resumes fretting]
Patrick: [Amongst the murmuring] What's wrong with my idea?
Fish 1: Let's get someone to go after it!
Mr. Krabs: There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm! [a horrible screeching noise is heard; the crowd cringes; we see a scary-looking old guy in a raincoat with a hook for a hand, scraping it on the window of the Krusty Krab; he stops]
Unnamed Sailor: You got a bathroom in this place?
Mr. Krabs: [looks slightly peeved] In the back.
Unnamed Sailor: [legs wobble] Thanks. [he runs for it]
Sandy: [under a wide-brimmed cowboy hat] I'll catch your worm for ya, that is, if you're willing to pay! [tips brim up]
Mr. Krabs: No! You'll never get a cent out of me! [runs to block the cash register with his body] Never! I'd rather that worm come in here right now and eat you all alive! [begins foaming at the mouth; the crowd looks at him strangely; he calms down] Sorry.
Sandy: [laughs good-naturedly] Aw, shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all. [Mr. Krabs chuckles, which gradually turns into crying; Sandy continues] Nope. I'm not gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone! [she shows them; crowd gasps] Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward! [crowd sympathizes] I am gonna get back what's mine! [crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: [looks alarmed] What? But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! [the three words appear on screen again]
Sandy: Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here. [she pulls out a wallet with pictures] Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms. [we see pictures of a real-life squirrel with a lasso around a bull, then a lasso around a worm] Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope. Now I'm gonna go kick me some worm tail! Yee-haw! [she runs to the doors of the Krusty Krab; the crowd goes wild]
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, you don't know!
Sandy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [chases after her] Sandy! Sandy!
Mr. Krabs: [amidst the still-cheering crowd] Go get 'em, Sandy! We have the utmost confidence in you! [crowd stops; Mr. Krabs turns to Patrick] Now, what was that idea of yours? [scene cuts to all the citizens trying to push the buildings of Bikini Bottom]
Patrick: PUSH! [citizens strain as they try to push the town; cut back to SpongeBob chasing after Sandy]
SpongeBob: Wait! Sandy!
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob, you coming to watch?
SpongeBob: Sandy, don't go!
Sandy: Why not?
SpongeBob: Sandy, I saw it! It's big... scary... and pink! [each word appears on the screen; "Big" displayed in large text, "Scary" in green drippy text, and "Pink" in a girly pink text]
Sandy: So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that neither!
SpongeBob: You'll get massacred! [collapses into sponge-cubes]
Sandy: SpongeBob, I'm from Texas. What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different "big"s. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down.
SpongeBob: Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?
Sandy: If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?
SpongeBob: [unconvincingly] Um, I do?
Sandy: You do? Where?
SpongeBob: Um... in my pocket.
Sandy: Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on! [SpongeBob looks nervous, pulls something from his pocket, and opens his hand] SpongeBob, that's a paper clip and a piece of string.
SpongeBob: [shakes head, meekly] No, it's not. This is your tail.
Sandy: [annoyed] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [defensively] How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go! [he jumps onto the front of Sandy's air helmet and hugs it]
Sandy: [pulls him off] SpongeBob, what is the matter with you? Now, I'm gonna go give that legless rascal what-for, and there ain't nothing you can say to stop me! [resumes walking]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen-fezibble-nukhip'?
Sandy: [stops] Well, I gotta admit, that's slowin' me down, but I'm still going for him! [continues]
SpongeBob: [appears next to Sandy as she strides along] You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home. [Sandy keeps walking; SpongeBob reappears] I've got ice cream! With nuts... [Sandy continues; SpongeBob appears once more, this time with a goofy squirrel mask on his face] Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!
Sandy: You ain't my pa!
SpongeBob: [stands in front of her with boxing gloves] Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me! [Sandy pushes through his body as if walking through a pair of swinging doors; he grabs her ankles, crying] Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!
Sandy: Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!
SpongeBob: [still crying and holding onto her ankles] No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!
Sandy: SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom? [she grabs an anchor and pulls a boat down from the surface]
SpongeBob: You are.
Sandy: And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, "K" in karate? [makes a K shape]
SpongeBob: [shaped like a U] You did.
Sandy: And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?
SpongeBob: [his butt has "Property of Sandy Cheeks" printed on it, states it meekly] You do.
Sandy: Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is! There ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for me to catch.
SpongeBob: Okay.
Sandy: Say it.
SpongeBob: There isn't anything...
Sandy: Ain't nothin'!
SpongeBob: [in a high-pitched voice like Sandy] Ain't nothin' [normal voice] too big or too ornery for you to catch. But... [Sandy cuts him off] But... [cuts him off again] And... [cuts him off again] We... [cuts him off again] I... [cuts him off again] Yeah but...
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: You see...
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: I... [Sandy cuts him off one last time with a frustrated groan]
Sandy: [picks up some sand from the ground as if tracking an animal and sniffs it] Worm sign. [she holds a small sign in her palm that has "WORM" painted on it; looks up] He's in that cave.
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you sure you...?
Sandy: Course I am! I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew. [she walks into the cave; SpongeBob hides behind a rock and shudders; we hear Sandy inside the cave] Aha! There you are, you tail-nabbin' varmint! Hi-yah! [we hear karate noises; Sandy peeks out of the cave] I'm winnin', SpongeBob! [resumes fighting]
SpongeBob: Sandy, that's not...! [more fighting noises; Sandy peeks out again]
Sandy: This shouldn't take long. [resumes fighting]
SpongeBob: Sandy, that's not...!
Sandy: Almost done!
SpongeBob: Sandy!
Sandy: Yee-haw! [comes out riding a pink segmented thing] I got him, SpongeBob! [makes a giant knot and stands on it proudly]
SpongeBob: [still uneasy] Sandy...?
Sandy: Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail! [we see that she has tied the fur to the small remainder of her tail]
SpongeBob: That's not the worm.
Sandy: [looking annoyed with her arms crossed] Pardon?
SpongeBob: That's not the worm. That's his tongue. [camera zooms out to show that SpongeBob is right; the opening of the cave is actually the worm's open mouth; his eyes make a squishy blinking noise]
Sandy: Ohhhh. This is the tongue, and... the whole thing... is the... worm. [freaks out] RUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIFE!!!! [they sprint away; the worm chomps down, roars angrily, and chases after them]
SpongeBob: So what's the plan, Sandy? [they look back and see that the worm is approaching faster]
Sandy: Run faster!
SpongeBob: I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!
Sandy: Later!
SpongeBob: Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?
Sandy: Not now, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I wanna hear you say it!
Sandy: Can we talk about this another time?
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Say it, or I'll trip you! [he continues running on one foot, the other poised to trip Sandy]
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: Not now!
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: Okay! You were right, and I was wrong. I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Are you happy now?
SpongeBob: [smiles triumphantly] I knew it. [the worm emits another huge growl; prompting the two to run even faster; they run up and down a sand mound, which the worm plows right through; they run past Fish 3, who is leaning over under his car's hood; his butt is bandaged up; the worm passes by and takes another bite out of him]
Fish 3: Not again!
SpongeBob: Uh, Sandy?
Sandy: Yeah?
SpongeBob: What do we do now?
Sandy: [is panting and sweating; the worm growls again; Sandy sees the seemingly endless coral trees in front of them] I've got it! SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?
SpongeBob: I'm way ahead of you, Sandy. [fashions a necklace out of them] Look, it's a necklace! S for "SpongeBob" or S for "Sandy"! That way they can identify our bodies.
Sandy: No, silly! How about S for "save our skins"? [she takes the string and uses the hook of the paper clip to wrap the string around one of the coral trees; she grabs SpongeBob and swings them up and over the branch onto the worm's back] Yee-haw! Now this is what I call a rodeo! We'll be nice and safe up here. [the worm starts to plow off a cliff like a runaway train; Sandy and SpongeBob realize this, scream, and begin running toward the end of worm to the safety of the plateau; they jump off safely as the worm falls off the cliff] We did it!
SpongeBob: Yay! He'll never get out of there!
Sandy: We saved the town!
SpongeBob: Yay! Let's go tell everybody! [they leave the scene and new scene shows all the citizens still trying to push Bikini Bottom to safety; the city is now in the valley at the bottom of the cliff]
Patrick: Push! [citizens push the city] Push! [push one last time]
Citizens: Hooray! [the worm lands on the city and crushes it]
Worm: Ouuuuuch...
Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon. Where the sun is hot and the sunbathers are oh so cool. [SpongeBob is laying on his back on a towel]
SpongeBob: What a beautiful day.
Patrick: You said it, pal.
SpongeBob: Can you believe that sun? [Patrick's eyes are singed]
Patrick: I could look at it all day. [SpongeBob sits up then takes his sunglasses off]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick? [Patrick's eyes go back to normal after he takes a drink]
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: Nothing.
Patrick: So, how's that tan coming?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Let me check. [lifts his pants and looks at his tan] Looking good. How's yours?
Patrick: Just a minute. [lifts his shorts and screams because his rear-end is showing. Patrick lays on his stomach] I could have sworn I was laying on my back. [both laugh as a swarm of people run by them. Larry is lifting six people on a surfboard. Everyone cheers]
SpongeBob: Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard! [three girls walk up to Larry]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Mr. Lifeguard, can I feel your muscle?
Larry: Sure. Don't scratch the paint. [Nancy and friends run off after feeling Larry's muscles. Scooter and friends come up next]
Scooter: Lifeguard, how’s the tubage?
Larry: Gnarly, dudes!
Scooter and friends: All right, yeah! Woohoo! [Scooter and friends run off as an elderly couple come up]
Elderly Man: Lifeguard, can you point out the snack bar?
Larry: Right over there! But you guys are way too old and unsightly for my beach. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Elderly Woman: [both walk off] So polite.
Elderly Man: Just like we raised him.
SpongeBob: What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine... if I were a lifeguard. [imagines himself in a lifeguard watchtower] That would be so cool!
Patrick: Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys. [Larry is being carried by a bunch of fish] Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies! [Patrick's belly expands. Nat walks by]
Nat: [Points at Patrick's belly] Dude, put that thing away. There are, like, children here. [Patrick pushes his belly fat into his feet]
Patrick: I'm going to the snack bar. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool. [zooms into a geek-like looking SpongeBob] I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by... [thunder roars] ...a flying ice cream truck. [ice cream truck with wings comes falling down] And live! [ice cream truck slows down and lands on top of SpongeBob, then drives away. SpongeBob's towel flies away]
Larry: [speaking into a megaphone] Please do not land flying ice cream trucks on the bathers! [As SpongeBob gets up, a vanilla ice cream cone falls off his nose] SpongeBob, you okay? [Larry notices the vanilla on SpongeBob's nose and mistakes it for sunscreen] Hey! I didn't know you were a lifeguard.
SpongeBob: Lifeguard?
Larry: The nose?
SpongeBob: [swipes his finger on his nose to see the ice cream] White stuff! You think I'm a lifeguard?
Larry: Sure! There’s no hiding the lifeguard look, SpongeBob, and you've got it.
SpongeBob: You really think so?
Larry: You bet I do. Say, we're a little shorthanded around here. How would you like to work the beach?
SpongeBob: [high voice] I'd love it! [hugs Larry]
Larry: Alright. [puts SpongeBob down] Leave that on the bench, Kahuna. Hey, Annette, come here! [fish walks over] I want you to meet my buddy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi. [Annette kicks sand in his face]
Larry: Hey, guy's a lifeguard. [Annette whistles as Nat, Shubie, and Bill run over and pick up SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It works! [SpongeBob has a suit similar to Larry's. Larry and SpongeBob walk around the beach blowing their whistles. Larry is putting lotion on Sadie and gives SpongeBob a thumbs-up. SpongeBob is putting lotion on Old Man Jenkins. Larry makes sand castles with children; SpongeBob lifts a bucket revealing an actual castle. The children play in the castle and Larry gives SpongeBob a thumbs up. Larry lifts some anchors as SpongeBob lifts two soda cups with straws for weights, Nat walks up and takes a cup, SpongeBob falls over on one side. Both hula dance playing ukuleles] Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry!
Larry: Yeah! Say, how'd you like to take the second shift?
SpongeBob: By myself?
Larry: Only if you think you're ready. [SpongeBob holds up a jar of zinc-oxide]
SpongeBob: I'm not just ready. [puts some of the zinc-oxide on his nose] I'm ready, Freddy.
Larry: It's Larry. Well, I guess I'll just...
Fish #2: Help, help! [a fish struggles in the water] Help, help, help!
Larry: We've got a sinker! SpongeBob, let me take this. I haven't seen any action all day.
SpongeBob: Action?
[Larry runs across the beach and dives into the water.]
Fish #2: Please help, please help! [Sinks underwater. Larry goes underwater to rescue him. Everyone gasps. Larry emerges from the water holding the unconscious fish. Everyone cheers except SpongeBob]
Larry: Breathe, darn you! [starts to punch the fish in the stomach. The fish regurgitates water and a book]
Fish #2: That's the last time I read and swim! You saved my life!
Larry: Don't mention it. It's all part of the job. [Larry walks up to SpongeBob, who is stunned] You know, SpongeBob, the babes and the big chair are great, but the best part is knowing you're the only thing that stands between these good people... [notice a sign that reads "Annual Hot Dog Chug" and everyone is rooting for Scooter, who is eating a bunch of hot dogs] ...and a watery grave. And that's what its all about. [a boat drives up] Their lives are in your hands now, ‘cause I got a date with the tanning booth. [Larry jumps in the boat with Nancy, Pilar, and Shubie] See ya. [the boat drives off]
SpongeBob: But I... [an inner tube inflates around him] ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes! [throws the inner tube off] Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen? [imagines everyone in the lake turns into tombstones. He screams, runs up to the lifeguard tower and rings the bell, then speaks into a megaphone] Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water! [the entire crowd runs out of the water] Emergency! [everyone wonders what is going on] Uhh... there are sharks in there! [a family of sharks is shown in the crowd]
Father Shark: Hey, that's my family you're talking about!
SpongeBob: Uhh... sea monster! [a giant, green sea monster walks over]
Sea Monster: You know, we sea monsters have made great strides in the fields of science and literature. [walks off as he smacks SpongeBob with his tail]
SpongeBob: Uhh, somebody went? [crowd of people are angry and go back to playing in the water] No, don't go! [SpongeBob screams whenever the fish are doing "dangerous" things in the water such as Harold splashing water at Annette, Frank water skiing with two female fish above him, two children playing catch the ball while inside a killer whale's mouth, and Frank the muscular fish hitting Scooter's head on a rock. He screams and then brings out an ice cream cart] Free ice cream! [everyone runs out of the water again and crowds around the cart] Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one? [everyone in the crowd eats their ice cream and sweet treats] A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming. [shows a clock. Everyone stops smiling] But just so you're not tempted... [ties everyone up with yellow "do not cross" tape including Scooter who is about to go surfing. He makes a bow-shaped knot after he's done tying everyone up] Ladies and gentlemen, uh, the lagoon is closed.
Scooter: We like Larry better!
SpongeBob: Does Larry ever give you [speaks into megaphone] free ice cream? [Patrick bursts out of a port-o-potty]
Patrick: Ice cream! [starts running around] Did somebody say [has a tissue paper behind his pants] ice cream? [runs up to the tape] Where is it? Is it here? [the words "do not cross" on the tape change into "ice cream"] Huh? Ice cream! Yay! [he laughs heartily and he breaks through the tape and runs into the lagoon but suddenly he gets an ache in his rear-end] Cramp! Ah! Ah! [he holds his behind then he begins to struggle in the water]
Frank: [notices Patrick struggling in the water] Holy cow! Somebody's drowning!
SpongeBob: [lounging at the top of the lifeguard tower] Oh, no, that's not possible. The lagoon is closed. [tied up group of fish angrily walk over to the tower]
Scooter: Dude, get your butt in the water!
SpongeBob: If there was anyone in there, we'd hear them.
Patrick: Help, help! [SpongeBob stands up and takes off his shades] I can't swim!
SpongeBob: Somebody would be screaming that they're drowning.
Patrick: I'm drowning! I'm drowning!
SpongeBob:  They would have to have crossed the line.
Patrick: I'm drowning ‘cause I crossed the line!
SpongeBob: [Looks at the angry fish. He takes out a pair of binoculars] Okay, I'll take a look, but just to prove to you that... [SpongeBob's eyes become huge and break through the lenses of the binoculars] ...Patrick isn't drowning! [SpongeBob sees Patrick drowning]
Patrick: Can't swim! Butt hurts! Ice cream! [SpongeBob jumps off the tower]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick! [runs to the shore, flailing his arms rapidly] I'm coming! [approaches the shore but stops to avoid touching the water]
Patrick: Help, help!
SpongeBob: Don't move! [gets a life preserver] Catch this! [throws it out to Patrick, but only lands about a foot out into the water]
Harold: Quit fooling around, man. Get in the water.
Patrick: Help, help!
SpongeBob: Oh, what am I going to do? Got to think. [starts running in circles] Gotta think. Gotta run around and think. Gotta run around and think at the same time. Gotta think, gotta have a plan. Gotta think, think, think. [the shape of his body turns into a light-bulb] I've got it! [takes out a straw] Patrick can't drown if there isn't any water! [sets straw in water and starts to suck out all the water, he grows huge] Well, you're safe now, Patrick.
Patrick: [inside SpongeBob] Help, I'm drowning! I've got butt cramps! I want ice cream and now it’s dark! [SpongeBob spits all the water out. Patrick is drowning again] Help, help! Help me, I'm drowning! Help! [SpongeBob runs to a couple sitting in a boat, about to share a hot dog]
Gus: To us. [he and Nancy are about to bite their hotdog when SpongeBob takes their boat and runs off. They make an angry look.]
SpongeBob: [comes back to return their hotdog] Sorry! Here's your hot dog. [hands them back their hot dog, then runs off and paddles the boat in the lagoon over to Patrick] Okay, Patrick, here I come! [Patrick is still flailing and screaming] Come, come round, Pat. Here I am. [Patrick grabs the boat and starts tearing it apart in a desperate frenzy. SpongeBob ushers him to stop, but the boat is torn completely into pieces and SpongeBob is in the water, too]
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [Both him and SpongeBob start struggling in the water, Patrick pushes SpongeBob underwater trying to stay afloat. Then he starts hitting SpongeBob with an anchor]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Help! Help us! We're drowning! [everyone who is tied up walks off whistling]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick!
Patrick: Goodbye, ice cream! [the two continue to struggle, Larry walks up behind them and picks them up, revealing that the water is very shallow, and only up to his ankles]
Larry: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Larry?
Larry: You're not a lifeguard, are you?
SpongeBob: No, Larry.
Larry: [carrying SpongeBob and Patrick in his hands] Let's go, guys. [later, SpongeBob and Patrick are paddling in a kiddie pool] Very good. You fellas are learning fast.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ow! Butt cramps!
Patrick: And I still don't have my ice cream.
Narrator: Ah, springtime in Bikini Bottom. All sea creatures have an innate sense of the seasonal changes... [Patrick jumps out of his rock with a purple sweater on] ...like the starfish. A quick survey of his environment... [scratches his back] ...and he knows that.
Patrick: It's spring!
Narrator: The starfish then sheds his winter coat [takes his sweater off] and stores it away safe for winter. [buries the sweater in the sand]
SpongeBob: [walks outside and smells the air] I'd better call the doctor, 'cause I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers. [sniffs them into his nose] Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Have you said hello to the flowers yet?
Squidward: [sighs] Good morning, flowers. [flowers hiss at him like snakes. Squidward screams and runs inside]
SpongeBob: Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers. [SpongeBob digs a hole and puts the flower in it] You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty. [turns around and grabs his container. When he turns back around, the flower is half eaten. He plants a new flower. When he turns around and grabs the container of water, he sees the flower is eaten again] Huh? [plants a new one] I'm not taking my eyes off you. [eyes stretch out staring at the flower]
Narrator: Three days later...
[SpongeBob is still staring, but his eyes have shriveled up. He uses the water to make his eyes normal]
Patrick: [running by] Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [turns around] Hi, Patrick! [when SpongeBob turns back around, the flower is eaten again] How does this keep happening? [notices a seahorse eating the flower next to him] Hi. [horse neighs then gallops onto a rock] She's beautiful! [SpongeBob imagines riding the seahorse with a head full of wavy hair] What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish? [scene cuts to seahorse eating some flowers and SpongeBob looking at her from a distance writing in a book] Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic. Perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty, or Debbie. [seahorse neighs] She must have spotted my floral bookmark! [using a flower bookmark in his book. Mystery gallops over slowly] She's coming this way. That's it, girl. Don't be afraid. I'm just a talking sponge, is all. [Mystery sniffs the bookmark and then eats it. Scene cuts to SpongeBob riding with Mystery, blowing a bubble heart, posting for Mystery, making stamp books, and walking out of a store laughing with hats. Scene cuts to nighttime in SpongeBob's bed where SpongeBob is sleeping on the floor and Mystery is in SpongeBob's bed] Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever? [Mystery is asleep] I'll take that as a yes!
Squidward: [it's now morning as Squidward rides his bike. SpongeBob and Mystery gallop by him] What the...?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Still riding a machine to work, I see!
Squidward: Don't say anything, Squidward, remember your karma. [Squidward's bike trips on something and he falls off a cliff, then explodes. He groans. SpongeBob arrives at the Krusty Krab and ties Mystery to a bike rack]
SpongeBob: Whoa, girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift. [walks in as Scooter and Martin walk by]
Scooter: Hey, look, Mr. Krabs put in a kiddy ride!
Martin: Why doncha try it out? [Scooter gets out a quarter]
Scooter: I can't find the coin slot. Here it is! [Scooter finds the coin slot but Mystery kicks Scooter into the background and he explodes]
Martin: [runs off; screams; still in Southern drawl] Help! Kiddy ride on the loose!
Mr. Krabs: [walks out] What's with all the ruckus? [gasps] A monster scaring away me customers!
SpongeBob: That's not a monster, Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery.
Mr. Krabs: You're a mystery, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob laughs] Get rid of it.
SpongeBob: Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!
Mr. Krabs: It's either you or Mystery.
SpongeBob: I knew I should've named her Debbie. [scene cuts to SpongeBob, sad, grilling up some patties]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!
SpongeBob: [in a sad voice] You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now, if we could only get rid of Squidward. [laughs then walks out]
SpongeBob: Good one, sir. [takes his pair of sad eye contacts off] Ha! It worked, girl! [opens the cabinet with Mystery inside it] We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build. [scene cuts to Patrick sitting down with a board on his forehead, doing absolutely nothing] Only eight more hours. [closes cupboards]
Narrator: Twelve seconds later... [Mystery peeks out of the cupboard]
SpongeBob: No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job. [SpongeBob gives her a tray with a patty on it] Wait a second. I bet you're hungry. How ‘bout some lunch? [Mystery eats the patty and neighs] Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob closes the cabinet quickly as Mr. Krabs comes bursting in] What was that? Is that horse in here?
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery. Weesnaw.
Mr. Krabs: Well, keep working on it! That was terrible! [walks out]
SpongeBob: That was close. [gets a tray with three patties] From now on, no more hijinks. Order up! [puts the tray on the window. Mystery eats it. Squidward walks up to the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob, where's my order?
SpongeBob: Did you look under the tray?
Squidward: No I didn't, sorry. [looks under the tray then sighs] SpongeBob, could you just get my order?
SpongeBob: They vanished. Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next? I gotta get out of here! [runs to the door]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!
SpongeBob: Oh.
Squidward: [Mystery approaches a customer's Krabby Patty] In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, [SpongeBob notices Mystery] you cook the food, then the customer gets the food. [SpongeBob's eyes move to the side of his face. Squidward is still talking] We do that for forty years and then we die. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say? [Mystery eats a Krabby Patty and she burps] 
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back. [grabs Mystery and shoves her under a cupboard]
Squidward: What's that?
SpongeBob: Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control! [closes the cupboard] Now then, you were saying?
Squidward: Just get my order. [walks out]
SpongeBob: You got it, Squidward? [chuckles] Ghosts. [Mystery eats SpongeBob's Krusty Krab work hat] Mystery, you ate my hat! [Mystery burps out a spatula] Mystery, you ate my spatula! You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins!
Old Man Jenkins: [from inside Mystery's belly] I don't want to be a burden.
Squidward: [customers yelling...] Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen.
Thaddeus: Where's our food?
Fred: I'm so hungry!
Tina: This is my only lunch hour!
Tom: Where's Old Man Jenkins?
Squidward: Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, what's going on in here?
Squidward: Why don't you ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?
Mr. Krabs: [runs into the kitchen] SpongeBob, what's the meaning of all these nicknames? David H. Jones! [SpongeBob is by Mystery's side, who has eaten too much]
SpongeBob: Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bicarbonate of soda. [Mystery spits out Old Man Jenkins]
Old Man Jenkins: What did I miss? [Mr. Krabs takes out his eyes, blows on them, rubs them, and puts them back on]
Mr. Krabs: So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs! Don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend! [Mystery licks SpongeBob's cheek. Squidward cries because of a bowl of onions near him]
Squidward: Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] You do?
Mr. Krabs: I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.
SpongeBob: What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffles] And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda! [sobbing] My best friend! [crying] [Squidward cries because of the onions again]
Squidward: What? Would you get out of here?
Mr. Krabs: The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard. [points to Mystery] Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse. [two customers spit out their patties]
SpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.
Nat Peterson: [crying because of the bowl of onions Squidward is holding under his nose] Hey!
SpongeBob: Okay, girl, you're free to go. [takes Mystery outside and takes Mystery's leash off] I can't keep you anymore. [cries] I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild. [Mystery gallops away] Well, what are you waiting for? Can't you see I don't want you anymore? [Patrick walks up with the board on his head, as SpongeBob bawls extremely harder] Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal! [resumes wailing intensely, Patrick walks away as Mr. Krabs walks up to SpongeBob] Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.
Squidward: Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad! [vault of money opens to show dollar bills that have been eaten and a bunch of money is missing]
Mr. Krabs: Get that horse! [He and SpongeBob run after Mystery.] 
SpongeBob: Mystery!
Mr. Krabs: Come back!
SpongeBob: Mystery! Weesnaw!
Both: Mystery, come back here!
[Scene cuts to Patrick, still with the board on his head, trying to enter a hat shop, but the board keeps bumping into the sides of the entrance repeatedly]
Squidward: [hands Harold his tray of food] Here you go, sir. A King-Size Ultra Krabby Supreme with the works, double batter fried [puts a stick into the food] on a stick.
Harold: Thanks! [walks off]
Squidward: Barnaclehead. [Harold comes back]
Harold: Pardon me?
Squidward: [holds up a mayonnaise bottle] You forgot your mayonnaise. [sets it on Harold's tray]
Harold: Thanks! [walks off and sits at his table]
Squidward: Look at them eating that garbage. [Harold bites into his food and squirts mayonnaise into his mouth] It's disgusting. They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: [laughing from the kitchen window] Good one, Squidward.
Squidward: Good what?
SpongeBob: Like you don't know. [hits Squidward on the back of the head] Saying, [imitates Squidward] "I hate Krabby Patties." [normal voice] That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties.
Squidward: Yeah, well, not me.
SpongeBob: [silence, chuckles] You're good at that. [jumps on top of the window] Hey, everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha! [everyone laughs]
Squidward: Don't encourage them! They'll never leave.
SpongeBob: [starts to grill more patties] Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say. [all the customers appear in the kitchen]
All: The only people who don't like a Krabby Patty, have never tasted one! [they all disappear]
Squidward: That's me. Never had one, never will. [SpongeBob flips a Krabby Patty through the ceiling of the Krusty Krab after hearing this]
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: [cleans out his ears] What? What did you say?
Squidward: I've never had a Krabby Patty and never will.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry... I don't...
Squidward: I've never had a Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob puts his glasses on and takes out a dictionary]
SpongeBob: Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?
Squidward: I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: [takes off his glasses and throws away the dictionary] Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now! [runs out of the kitchen holding a Krabby Patty] No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this.
Squidward: [slaps the patty out of SpongeBob's hand] Get that garbage outta my face! [SpongeBob runs off and brings it back]
SpongeBob: If you try it, you'll love it!
Squidward: Try one of those radioactive sludge-balls you call food? Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick. [pan over to Patrick dressed as a cowboy, standing next to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [to Patrick, whispering] Sorry, Patrick. [Patrick sighs and walks off sadly. SpongeBob tries to give Squidward the patty again] Come on, you're gonna—
Squidward: [pushes the patty away] No.
SpongeBob: Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo... [Squidward slaps it away]
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: [reaches behind Squidward's ear] Whoop! What's that in your ear? [pulls out a patty]
Squidward: Quit it.
SpongeBob: Come on, open wide!
Squidward: SpongeBob, if I were trapped at the bottom of a well, for three years, with nothing to eat but that Krabby Patty, I'd eat my own legs first... [walks out from behind the counter] and not just the extra ones. [walks off as SpongeBob follows]
SpongeBob: But it's good for you!
Squidward: [turns around] G—good for you?! That thing is a heart attack on a bun!
SpongeBob: No, Squidward, I meant... good for your soul. [background turns to a heaven-like sky and SpongeBob wearing wings and a halo and doves are seen flying in the background and a choir is heard]
Squidward: Oh, puh-lease! I have no soul! [background turns to fire, and flying bats and evil laughter is heard. Squidward walks off]
SpongeBob: Okay, just half.
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: A quarter?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: One bite?
Squidward: No. [Squidward enters the bathroom. When he opens a stall door, SpongeBob shows him the patty]
SpongeBob: Just smell it.
Squidward: If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?! [slams the door. Cut to Squidward washing dishes. SpongeBob rises up, made with pink bubble in the sink, holding the Krabby Patty in his hand]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward.
Squidward: No. [all the bubbles pop, including the Krabby Patty. Cut to Squidward putting money in the register. SpongeBob pops out of the register with coins on his head and eyes]
SpongeBob: One bite.
Squidward: No... [cash drawer shuts. Cut to Squidward taking out the trash. SpongeBob pops up from inside the trashcan, made with fruit and trash]
SpongeBob: You won't be sorry.
Squidward: [throws the garbage bag on SpongeBob in the trash can] No! [turns around and sees SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It's delicious...
Squidward: Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up? [SpongeBob handcuffs himself to Squidward. Squidward takes the patty] Give me that! When I die...you stay away from my funeral. [looks at the patty, patty juice falls out] Ohh... do I really...
SpongeBob: Ahhhhh... [Squidward stretches his mouth] Eeeeee.... Oooooh-oooooh-oooh... [Squidward takes a tiny bite of the Krabby Patty and smiles. SpongeBob's eyes turn into hearts]
Squidward: Why... this Krabby Patty may be the most... [suddenly angry] Horrible! Putrid! [SpongeBob's eyes turn into atomic explosions] Poorly prepared! Vile! Unappetizing! Disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat!
SpongeBob: But—
Squidward: [throws the patty on the ground] And I curse this Krabby Patty, [stomps on the patty] and all who enjoy them, [uses a wooden plank to smash the patty] to an early and well-deserved grave! [close-up on a shocked SpongeBob. Puts a tombstone on top of the patty with 'R.I.P.' and a picture of a patty on it] Get it?
SpongeBob: But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good. Nobody is immune to its tasty charms.
Squidward: Nobody but me.
SpongeBob: Are you sure?
Squidward: Does this look unsure to you? [close-up of Squidward's wrinkly face]
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: Good! Now go spread the word! [SpongeBob's eyes well up with tears as he walks back into the Krusty Krab. When he shuts the door, Squidward gasps and digs for the Krabby Patty] Come on! Come on! Come on! [holds up the Krabby Patty covered in sand] Ah... still alive! [shoves the whole thing in his mouth] Oh, soooo delicious! [cries] Oh...! All the wasted years...! [licks the ground] I gotta have more. I gotta have more! [runs to the back of the Krusty Krab and is about to open the door, but doesn't] But wait! [stands by the window. His eyes float over to the side of his face looking at SpongeBob grilling] After that performance, he'd never let me live it down! I gotta sneak one. Just one, then... I'm off the stuff for good!
SpongeBob: I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties. [flips one in the air. Squidward peaks through the window]
Squidward: Uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?
Squidward: I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun, [gets more excited] with— with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?
SpongeBob: Coming right up! [flips the patties again] Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy. [Squidward moans and groans. His pupils flip as the patty does] But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old [indistinct. Squidward licks his lips] ...and they all don't have to like the same things. [the steam from the patties forms a figure and it kisses Squidward's nose then disappears]
Squidward: Don't go...
SpongeBob: ...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it. [SpongeBob holds up the Krabby Patty. Squidward tries to take a bite, but SpongeBob takes it away and Squidward's face goes into the grill] You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite. [walks off. Squidward looks up with a burnt face. SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen] Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.
Squidward: Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back.
SpongeBob: Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so... [eats the whole patty in one bite. Squidward gasps] Well, whoever they were, they had great taste! [Squidward groans and chatters, then starts to cry] Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work! [walks back into the kitchen]
Squidward: What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage? [Frank with a big belly walks up to the trash can with a partially eaten Krabby Patty]
Frank: I wish I could eat this, but I'm so darn full. Oh well. [drops the patty in the garbage]
Squidward: I had to say garbage... but, okay! [runs to the garbage can. Inhales deeply and eats everything in the garbage can. When he lifts up his head, the Krabby Patty is the only thing left in the garbage. He spits out what's in his mouth and grabs the Krabby Patty. SpongeBob runs over and grabs it out of his hand]
SpongeBob: Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated! [runs to the furnace and throws it in and cries. Squidward walks up] I know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came. [runs off as Squidward starts crying. Cut to nighttime where Squidward is sitting in his chair, still crying, when there is a knock on the door. Squidward answers it and it's a giant Krabby Patty. Squidward kisses it and sighs. Cut to Squidward having dinner with the patty, marrying the patty [where Nat Peterson talks inaudibly], having a child with the patty, and growing old with it. Dream sequence ends]
Squidward: Hmm, honey...? [wakes up] What? Oh... I have got to get my hands on a Krabby Patty! And no one's gonna stop me! [runs out of his house, panting, but tiptoes past SpongeBob's house, then pants some more to the Krusty Krab, putting his face up against the door] There it is... unguarded! All I have to do is... Wait... It's too easy. There must be some kind of... [Squidward sees dripping coming from above the door inside] security? [Squidward looks up and notices a bucket] This is our burglar alarm? A bucket of water? Ha-ha. [Squidward walks in, knocking the bucket off the door] That was too easy. [sniffs] Hey, this isn't water, this is...gas! [A robotic arm with a match drops it, lighting a screaming Squidward on fire, who runs all the way into the kitchen, where another bucket of gas falls on him and fire is seen again, as he screams again. And then he walks up to the Patty Vault, wide-eyed, and opens the door to reveal hundreds and hundreds of Krabby Patties]
Squidward: Holy shrimp! I don't know where to start. [picks up a patty] All that matters is that it's just you... and me... and nobody...
SpongeBob: Squidward? [Squidward's face drops] Is that you?
Squidward: [turns around] SpongeBob? Uh, uh, uh... what are you doing here? [points at SpongeBob. While pointing at him, he notices he's showing the patty in his hand and puts it behind his back again]
SpongeBob: I always come to work at 3:00 A.M. This is when I count the sesame seeds. [takes off his green hat] What are you doing here?
Squidward: Uhh, I forgot my...
SpongeBob: And why is the patty vault open?
Squidward: Oh, I thought that...
SpongeBob: And why are you holding a patty behind your back?
Squidward: I... I... I... no, I didn't do...
SpongeBob: And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And... [grins]
Squidward: No, no, wait... it's not what you think. Th-this is a big misunderstanding. You've got to believe me, I... Listen, I am telling you... [jumps up and down] You better listen to me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward? [Squidward begins to sweat, then slams the door on SpongeBob]
Squidward: Yes! Yes! I admit it, SpongeBob! I love Krabby Patties! [eats two patties]
SpongeBob: I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty! [Squidward eats a bunch of Krabby Patties in all sorts of ways, even a dozen at a time] Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward! [Squidward keeps eating all the Krabby Patties in the vault, Pac-Man style] Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward! [As soon as he ate dozens of Krabby Patties]
Squidward: What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?
SpongeBob: No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs...!
Squidward: My thighs? [pan down showing Squidward's enlarged thighs, he looks at thighs]
SpongeBob: ...and then you'll blow up! [Krusty Krab explodes. Squidward's head is sitting on the ambulance's bench while his legs are in a bucket]
Joe: [laughs] Yeah, I remember my first Krabby Patty.
Narrator:  Oh, a dark and stormy night. It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed the health inspector. [laughs evilly. Stormy night becomes calm day] It was a bright and sunny morning. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where a fish drives up and stops in front of the restaurant. The scene zooms into his badge that reads 'Health Inspector']
Mr. Krabs: [Taking a bath in money] Ah...That smells like... [gasps] ...the health inspector! [Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob in a yellow towel] Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here! [both are peeking out the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is writing on a clipboard] If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry. [eyes widen] The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
Mr. Krabs: You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son? [pushes SpongeBob out the door] Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him. [SpongeBob walks up to the health inspector, who is still writing on his clipboard at the table]
SpongeBob: What can I get for you...handsome?
Mr. Krabs: [facepalms] We're doomed.
Health Inspector: I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.
SpongeBob: [walking backwards back into the kitchen] Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up! [SpongeBob enters the kitchen, where Krabs waits] He wants one of everything.
Mr. Krabs: Then we'll give him a smorgasbord! [holds up a tray of a patty, a drink, some fries, and coral bits] The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run up to the health inspector]
SpongeBob: Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir! [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven. [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
SpongeBob: The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite. [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Fresh Sludge Pudding? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
SpongeBob: More Diet Red Tide? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Some Fried Flotsam? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Health Inspector: Please, gentlemen! [swallows all the food in his mouth] Leave me to finish my work in peace. [clicks his pen, which is actually a fork that comes out. Later, the health inspector has eaten everything on the table and belches]
SpongeBob: And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
Health Inspector: [writes on his clipboard] So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.
SpongeBob: [open kitchen door] He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear! [both dance off then leapfrog over each other, across the screen then do the can-can in dresses until a news report comes on tv]
Johnny Elaine: We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin. Be on the lookout for a man, who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food. That's all for now. [Mr. Krabs gets angry]
Mr. Krabs: [Yells] Free food?!
SpongeBob: Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
Mr. Krabs: You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!
SpongeBob: Duped?!
Mr. Krabs: Bamboozled!
SpongeBob: We've been smeckledorfed!
Mr. Krabs: That's not even a word, and I agree with ya! [both look through the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is wiping his mouth off, finishing his drink, and cleaning his teeth with a toothpick] Look at him. I bet he never changes his underpants.
SpongeBob: I bet he bites whale bubbles.
Mr. Krabs: I bet his mom bought him that hat. [holds up a krabby patty] If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one. [flicks the top bun off and puts a some volcano sauce on the patty] You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!
SpongeBob: It doesn't seem right... [holds up a bottle of seahorse radish] ...but it feels so good! [dumps a spoonful on the patty] Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean. 
SpongeBob: See anything yet, Patrick?
Patrick: I need my glasses. [puts two glasses of water on his eyes like binoculars, which are real human eyes.] Hmmm... [a mail truck approaches] ...it's the mail truck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Our package! [Patrick throws the glasses and they both start dancing and hopping]
Squidward: I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.
Norton: SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: That's me! [Norton throws a big box next to him and Patrick]
Squidward: That's a big box!
SpongeBob: Thank you! [still dancing and hopping]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?
SpongeBob: Thirty more seconds, Patrick. [rubs hands together]
Squidward: They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap. [laughs as SpongeBob and Patrick lift up a big-screen TV out of the box] Huh? A brand-new television?
SpongeBob: Easy... easy... [both him and Patrick throw the TV onto a trash-can]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah! [jump into the box and close the flaps]
Squidward: Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider. [walks up to the box with SpongeBob and Patrick inside] Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?
SpongeBob: [as he emerges from the box] Pretty smart, huh?
Patrick: [emerges from the box] I thought it wouldn't work.
Squidward: Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah. [yells in SpongeBob and Patrick's faces] Don't you two have any brains?!
SpongeBob: Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our... [makes a rainbow over his head with his hands] ...imagination!
Squidward: Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?
SpongeBob: With... [SpongeBob jumps on the flap of the box, makes another rainbow with his hands] ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate! [curls his finger in a hook shape] Arrrrr! A football player! [stands in a football player stance] Hup!
Patrick: A starfish!
Squidward: Patrick, you're already a starfish.
Patrick: See, Squidward? It works! You try!
Squidward: [rubs his two tentacles on both sides of his head] Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV... [points to the one on the trash-can] ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sure, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! [Squidward runs to the TV and pushes it to his house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!
Patrick: Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!
SpongeBob: Let's go for it! [pulls the flaps of the box over on them] Gloves!
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Hats!
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Underwear!
Patrick: Uh... check!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.
Patrick: You got it! [climbing noises come from the box]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!
Squidward: I hope they put some air holes in that box. [goes inside his house]
SpongeBob: Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!
Patrick: I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo! Excelsior!
Squidward: [opens his door] Now where's that remote? [walks up to the remote, which is right next to the box. He picks it up, puts it in his shirt and stands next to the box, listening to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: I am the lizard king! Whoo!
SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!
Patrick: What should we keep down?
Squidward: Morons.
SpongeBob: Our voices!
Squidward: Will you two shut up?! [kicks the box, causing the sound of an avalanche, making SpongeBob and Patrick scream and fall, they both start to cry. Squidward is shocked] Sponge... Bob? [he softly touches the box, causing another avalanche]
Patrick: Hold me.
SpongeBob: Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!
Patrick: SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw! [Squidward begins to sweat]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I can't do that!
Patrick: Why not?
SpongeBob: Because I already cut off my own arms! [Squidward kneels down]
Patrick: Nooooo!
[Squidward quickly opens the box and looks in. SpongeBob and Patrick sit inside the box]
Squidward: [confused] What the? How were you two making that noise?
SpongeBob: [laughs] What noise, Squidward?
Patrick: I could only hear the sound of our laughter.
Squidward: Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...
Patrick: Don't forget the second avalanche.
Squidward: Forget it. [closes the box] I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television. [helicopter sounds are heard from the box, Squidward looks around at the sky and ducks]
Pilot Inside Box: Attention climbers, please hold on! The saws are on the way!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
Squidward: Grrrr... Aha! [he opens the box again and sees SpongeBob and Patrick sitting inside the box again] How are you two doing that?
SpongeBob: First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet...
Squidward: The noises! How are you two making those noises?
Patrick: That's easy. All you need is a box.
SpongeBob: And... [makes another rainbow with his hands] ...imagination.
Squidward: [as SpongeBob and Patrick duck down into the box] Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination... [tries to make a rainbow with his hands, like SpongeBob, but is unsuccessful] ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.
Patrick: That's good. Now all you need is a box. [closes the box]
Squidward: [walks back to his house] I'll show them! [looks in his closet] There's got to be one in here! [finds a small, round green box] Ah! This hat box should do nicely. [pulls out a Mexican sombrero] Why haven't I worn this yet? [throws it off-screen, gets in the box but he is too big for it and then just sits there. He then frowns, looks at his watch and then gets mad and kicks the box. Police sirens are heard]
Policeman Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's box: Attention! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
Squidward: What do they want with me? What did I do? [he gasps] Obviously I violated some new boxing law! [walks out of his house showing the green box] Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!
Criminal Inside Box: You'll never take me alive, coppers!
Man Inside Box: No, Johnny! Don't do it! [Police sirens are heard. Squidward gets angry and kicks his green box toward SpongeBob and Patrick's box]
Patrick: [opens box and sirens stop] Whoopee! Another box! [Patrick takes the hat box and closes the box they're sitting in and police sirens are heard again]
Squidward: I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV. [turns on TV to see a show with boxes on a conveyor belt in a factory]
Male TV narrator: It is here that the boxes reach their final stage of assembly. [changes channel to an old professor talking about a box equation on a chalkboard]
Professor: The equation is demonstrated here by this box. [changes channel to a soap opera with a man and woman]
Man: I couldn't afford a present this year, so I got you this box. [he holds up a box]
Woman: That's what I got you! [she also holds up a box]
Squidward: Isn't there anything on that isn't about boxes?! [changes channel to a boxing match on TV]
Announcer: And welcome back to Championship Boxing.
Squidward: [chuckles in hope] Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes. [two boxes go at each other in the ring] I give up.
Astronaut Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's Box: 3... 2... 1... blast off! [a loud rocket takes off noises are heard from the box]
Squidward: [fascinated] How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think! [he imagines SpongeBob and Patrick playing a tape recorder with real rocket sound effects]
SpongeBob: Squidward's such a jerk. [both laugh]
Squidward: Laugh at me, will they? [opens box once again] All right, where is it?
Patrick: [comes out of Squidward's green hat box] Here I am!
SpongeBob: Where's what, Squidward?
Squidward: Don't "Where's what, Squidward?" me! Where's the tape recorder?
SpongeBob: We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!
Squidward: Don't "We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!" me!
SpongeBob: But we don't!
Patrick: [holds up a small, white, rectangular box in his hand] We have a tape recorder box.
Squidward: [takes the small, white box from Patrick and throws it offscreen] All right, make way you two, I'm coming in. [gets into box]
SpongeBob: Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S... [makes a rainbow with his hands once more] ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?
Squidward: No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.
SpongeBob: Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is about! It's about... [makes one last rainbow with his hands] ...imagination.
Squidward: All right, fine! [as he makes the rainbow go away with his hands] Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is! [SpongeBob and Patrick close their eyes and make pirate and robot sounds]
Patrick: [imitates robot] Beep-beep-beep.
SpongeBob: [imitates pirate] Arr.
Patrick: Beep-boop-bee-boop.
SpongeBob: Ahoy matey!
Patrick: Beep-beep.
SpongeBob: For that you'll walk the plank! [SpongeBob giggles softly, and Patrick starts chuckling goofily]
Squidward: [he gets angry. he growls] Why won't this thing turn on?! [he slams the bottom of the box with his fists] All right, fine. If you don't want to show me, [gets out of the box] I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing. [Squidward paces back and forth in his house] How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that! [he hears real robotpirate battle noises from box] Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to! [he sits in his chair until nighttime]
[firework and cheering sounds are heard coming from the box. Patrick and SpongeBob come out of the box and Patrick yawns]
Narrator: Ahh, the Krusty Krab. Through these doors pass all the many kinds of undersea life. [two fish are about to leave]
Mermaid Man: Through the double doors! [bursts through the door, knocking the two fish away] Away!
Narrator: And also these guys. [Barnacle Boy enters the Krusty Krab]
Barnacle Boy: I told you I'm not hungry, Mermaid Man!
Mermaid Man: N-nonsense, Barnacle Boy, we've got to keep up our strength for the fight against evil!
Barnacle Boy: What a dive.
Mermaid Man: To the register! [runs to the register] Away!
Squidward: Can I help you?
Mermaid Man: A double Krabby Patty and Coral Bits for me, and a silly meal for the lad.
Barnacle Boy: It's not for the toy, I just... I've gotta fit in the tights, y'know? [he smiles nervously]
Squidward: Whatever. Five dollars, please.
Mermaid Man: You got it, bucky. [removes his left seashell cup, opens the shell up like a clutch purse and pulls out a metal nut] Will this cover it? [close up of the nut and a timpani noise is heard]
Squidward: No.
Barnacle Boy: [confronts Squidward] Listen, big nose, [points at Mermaid Man] that guy has been saving your butt since before you were born. Don't you got a living legend discount or something?
Squidward: This is a restaurant, not a lending library. [pokes Barnacle Boy] And who are you calling big nose, [pokes Barnacle Boy again] big nose? [both press noses against each other. Barnacle Boy gets out a $5 bill from his hat and he throws it to Squidward]
Barnacle Boy: Well, next time danger threatens, don't expect any help from us.
Squidward: [grabs the bill. Sarcastically] I'm shakin'. Heh. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob: [slowly breaks through wall] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Must... get... autograph! [stretches arm to pull a pen from Tom's shirt pocket and stretches second arm to grab a paper from the window]
Mermaid Man: If you wanna grow up strong like me,... [shows his fat belly, shocking Barnacle Boy] you gotta leave room for seconds. Here comes our waiter.
SpongeBob: [runs while making a weird face] Autograph!
Barnacle Boy: Holy sea cow, it's that Sponge-kid!
Mermaid Man: Quick, lad, [pants falls down] to the invisible boat mobile! [runs outside, while holding his pants] Away!
Barnacle Boy: Where'd we park?
Mermaid Man: Uhh...
SpongeBob: Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone. [gasps] Mermaid Man's belt!
Mermaid Man: Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm! [he pulls it out, and makes as to press a button. A car flickers in and out of visibility thrice, making beeps as well] There she is! [they run over and jump in the car. Barnacle Boy hits the seat divider]
Barnacle Boy: Eee-ow! [rubs his behind] I told you we shoulda got the automatic!
SpongeBob: Hey, guys! Wait up! [pulling out Mermaid Man's belt; slow motion] I've got something for you...
Barnacle Boy: Floor it! [both speed off in the boat]
SpongeBob: You forgot your belt! You forgot— [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away] Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it. [makes one step in the boat's direction... then sprints back to the kitchen with the belt on] Or not. [giggles] I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does. [presses the belt, and a pickle barrel shrinks] Whoa. [grabs the shrunken barrel] The small ray. [he giggles and smiles mischievously]
Squidward: Here's your shake, sir. [he starts to hand him the shake, but he is startled by a loud noise from the kitchen and SpongeBob's giggle, causing him to accidentally drop the shake on the guy's head. The guy punches Squidward in the face and storms out. There are more flashes, noises and giggles from the kitchen. Squidward gets up and he holds his head] Grr.
SpongeBob: [Hands a tiny Krabby Patty to a cockroach] There you go. Come again, sir. [Squidward barges in] 
Squidward: SpongeBob. What's going on in here? Huh? [SpongeBob wears a tiny hat and holds a tiny spatula, and a cockroach is eating a Krabby Patty while sitting on a shrunken dining table] Why's everything all tiny?
SpongeBob: [turns the belt around to hide it from Squidward] I don't know.
Squidward: What do you got there?
SpongeBob: Nothing.
Squidward: No, really?
SpongeBob: Nothing.
Squidward: You've got something, alright. Let's see it. [Squidward grabs SpongeBob and sees Mermaid Man's belt]
SpongeBob: No, no!
Squidward: [gasps] Is that Mermaid Man's belt?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: Wow. I can't believe he'd lend it to you.
SpongeBob: Me, uh... either. [chuckles nervously]
Squidward: [gasps] He didn't lend it to you, did he?
SpongeBob: Please don't tell!
Squidward: [angry] You stole it!
SpongeBob: Please don't tell!
Squidward: Oh, I'm telling.
SpongeBob: Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!
Squidward: Uh-oh! [points at the phone hanging on the kitchen wall] There's the phone.
SpongeBob: Don't!
Squidward: I'm walking towards the phone! [slowly walks towards phone]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: [slowly reaches for the phone] I'm getting closer to the phone.
SpongeBob: [sobbing] Do-o-o-n't!
Squidward: [picks up the phone, ready to call Mermaid Man] And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.
SpongeBob: [wails and tears himself] I'm begging you!
Squidward: Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid... [SpongeBob shrinks Squidward.  He lands on the table] What the? What? [phones hits Squidward on the head] Ow!
Mermaid Man:  [on phone] Hello? Hello?
Squidward: What did you do to me?!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!
Squidward: SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are gonna be in really big trouble!
SpongeBob: Uh... uh, okay, uh...
Squidward: I said now!
SpongeBob: Uh... [belt is shown to have several complicated buttons] Uh...
Squidward: Do you hear me?! [SpongeBob zaps Squidward and he appears with multiple eyes with hissing snakes] Holy fish paste! Get it off me! Get it off me! [takes eyes off him and pants in fear] Don't you know how to work that thing?!
SpongeBob: Uhh, I can do it! [SpongeBob changes Squidward into a burning mess, then changes him to have an enormous nose, then to have no skin, then cut in half by scissors, then changed into more things off-screen while SpongeBob looks in fright. Squidward screams whenever SpongeBob changes him]
Squidward: [looks burnt after SpongeBob’s failed attempts to revert him] Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and--
SpongeBob: [snatching Squidward] No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience. [he runs to Patrick's house, where Patrick is sleeping] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!
Patrick: [wakes up due to surprise] Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look. [shows Patrick the shrunken Squidward]
Patrick: A Squidward action figure! [grabs Squidward] Let me play with him!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick!
Patrick: Fighter pilot! [imitates jet plane diving, machine gunfire and explosion noises] Dive bomb!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: [about to punch Squidward] And then comes a giant fist!
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.
Patrick: Oh... [about to punch Squidward anyway] And then comes a giant -- [Squidward screams] 
SpongeBob: [stops Patrick] Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
Patrick: Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day.
SpongeBob: You think so?
Patrick: Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size. [pulls out a pickle] Like this pickle! See? They like each other!
Squidward: N-n-n-n-no. [Patrick bangs them together as if to kiss. Squidward is disgusted]
SpongeBob: Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!
Patrick: Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You got it set to [points to the M] 'M' for Mini when it should be set to [turns M around] 'W' for Wumbo.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.
Patrick: Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He, she, me... wumbo! Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!
Squidward: [while Patrick is saying "we'll have the wumbo"] I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.
Patrick: Well, all right, then. Let her rip! [SpongeBob uses Mermaid Man's belt and presses something to try and "regrow" Squidward. Only Patrick and Squidward are both shrunk now] It worked!
SpongeBob: Oh no!
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob's giant! [SpongeBob grabs them] Can I be giant next?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!
Patrick: You're kidding! [pulls out his pickle] Good thing I still got this pickle! [kisses the pickle three times. Pan over to Squidward]
Squidward: Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!
SpongeBob: [yells in Squidward's face] No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise. [gets a jar and puts them in] Until then, you'll be safe in this jar.
Patrick: You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something. Heheh.
SpongeBob: It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it. [Sandy suddenly appears]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams] Sandy! [shrinks Sandy]
Sandy: [lands on the ground] What did you... For cryin' out... What did y'all do to me?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and... [Larry appears]
Larry: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks Larry]
Nat: Hey, SpongeBob, I -- [shrinks Nat]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Hi, SpongeBob. [shrinks Nancy; SpongeBob screams and makes a run for it]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, SpongeBob. [shrinks Mrs. Puff]
Scooter: Sponge-dude! [shrinks Scooter, Sandals, and Dennis]
Fish #1: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks fish]
Fish #2: SpongeBob, hi! [shrinks fish]
Fish #3: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks fish]
Fish #4: What's up, Sponge? [shrinks fish]
SpongeBob: [tries to fit everyone in the jar] Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
Sandy: Well, you can't leave us small forever!
SpongeBob: You don't understand! [SpongeBob's mother is seen in the jar]
Mrs. SquarePants: [gently and soothingly] SpongeBob. You need to admit your mistakes.
SpongeBob: Mom?
Mermaid Man: Your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand.
Barnacle Boy: You're Mermaid Man, you old coot!
Mermaid Man: Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...
Mermaid Man: [comforting SpongeBob] Awww, don't worry, son. I understand! [SpongeBob smiles, with tears still pooling in his eyes] Why, I remember back when I first used the belt, the year was nineteen aught eleventeen twelve, why I believe the president.
Everyone: Just tell him how to unshrink us!
Mermaid Man: Oh, yes. The unshrink ray. Let's see, uh, uh— Did you set it to Wumbo?
Everyone: What?! [the jar rumbles from anger and everyone flies out of the jar, spells out and form GET SPONGEBOB!] Get SpongeBob! [climbs up SpongeBob's body and into the holes in his head]
Squidward: Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom... in my own home! [kicks SpongeBob's stomach]
Sandy: And I need an elevator to climb one stair! Hi-ya! [punches his brain]
Mermaid Man: We've been shrinking for years!
Barnacle Boy: But this is ridiculous! [both kick his eyeballs. Dale kicks his pelvis, Nancy chops off one of his lungs while hanging on to his spine, Larry kicks his knee. SpongeBob is shown getting hurt from the outside]
Everyone: Everything's too big!
SpongeBob: I've got it! [Squidward saws a blood vein and Frank tries to break a bone, but stop when SpongeBob shrinks the city] Ta-da! [everyone looks outside through his holes] Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small! [everybody leaves SpongeBob's body] And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese! [turns the shrink ray into W and towards him like a camera and shrinks himself]
Squidward: I guess this is okay.
Larry: Yeah, what's the difference?
Nancy: Good idea, SpongeBob. [everyone cheers, balloons and other party items are flying, as a bus comes back and Plankton gets off of it]
Plankton: Well, it's great to be back! [notices small Bikini Bottom] Huh?
Narrator: [Camera cuts to the exterior of The Krusty Krab] Closing time at the Krusty Krab. 
Mr. Krabs: [Counting the change in the cash register] 51, 52, 53... 
Squidward: [Counting his suction cups] 29, 30, 31... 
SpongeBob: [Mopping in synchronization] One, two, three. One, two, three. 
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, can we please go now? 
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy. 
SpongeBob: [Referencing the manual] "The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for." 
Squidward: But that's not fair! 
SpongeBob: [Referencing the manual, again] "Clause 3b: The proprietor reserves the right to be unfair." 
Squidward: Teacher's pet. 
Mr. Krabs: Let's see... [counts money in register] five, ten, 25, blue, apple sauce. Everything looks to be in order. Except... [gasps] Where is it? [takes apart the register in search of something] Where is it? 
Squidward: What? 
Mr. Krabs: My dime! Me special dime, the first dime I ever made! I always keep it in the back of the register for luck! 
Squidward: Well, I've never seen it. [Mr. Krabs glares at Squidward in suspicion] 
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on a stack of interpretive dance quarterlies? [pulls out a stack of dance quarterlies] 
Squidward: Of course I'm... [makes a shocked face] What are you saying? 
Mr. Krabs: Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test! [holding a lie detector in his hands] 
Squidward: You're saying something! 
Mr. Krabs: Heavens to Betsy, no. It's just that me lucky dime's gone missin', and you've been working the register all day! 
Squidward: Are you accusing me of something? 
Mr. Krabs: Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you stole it. Two, you stole it. Or three—you stole it! 
Squidward: [enraged] I didn't take your precious dime! 
Mr. Krabs: Show me your tentacles. 
Squidward: What?! 
Mr. Krabs: I wanna see empty suction cups. 
Squidward: [squeezes Mr. Krabs' eyes with his tentacles in anger] Here! Here! Here! See 'em?! [stomps away] 
Mr. Krabs: You... you can't do that to me. I'm your boss! 
Squidward: Not anymore, Mr. Krabs. I quit! [throws his hat down. The hat falls in slow motion] 
SpongeBob: [gasps] No. [catches the hat with a pillow] Whew. 
Squidward: I'm outta here! 
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're making a big mistake! 
Squidward: Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab! 
SpongeBob: But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles? [smiles really big] 
Squidward: Being dead or anything else! 
SpongeBob: I never knew you felt so strongly about it. 
Squidward: Where have you been? 
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter. [Norma appears with cookies on a silver platter and offers SpongeBob a cookie] 
Norma Rechid: Free sample? 
SpongeBob: Cookies! [Takes one, and eats it] 
Squidward: Can I have one- [Norma is already gone] 
SpongeBob: Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me... [grabs Squidward and pulls him toward himself] ...we're like brothers, only closer. [lifts Squidward's shirt and their hearts are somehow joined together and beating in unison. Creepy alien music plays before Squidward screams and leaps away from SpongeBob] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to. [imagines himself in various following jobs] I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman. 
SpongeBob: Or a football playing king in space... with a mustache. 
Squidward: [narrows his eyes] Yeah... uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... Goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands! [skips to a homeless Squidward in a box trying to get spare change in a cup from passersby] Spare change? Spare change, ma'am? 
SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward, is that you? 
Squidward: Uh, I, uh... [closes his box] 
SpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob. [opens his box up] We used to work together. 
Squidward: SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: There ya go. So, where you living these days? 
Fish: Squidward Tentacles? 
Squidward: Yes? 
Fish: Sign here please. [Squidward signs and the fish takes his box] 
Squidward: Uh... nowhere. 
SpongeBob: Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess! Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell... you're a football player? 
Squidward: No. 
SpongeBob: A spaceman? 
Squidward: No. 
SpongeBob: A football playing king in space- 
Squidward: Don't you get it? [sobs] I'm a lose-e-er! I lost my job, my home, everything! 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Even your paintings? 
Squidward: Nobody would take them. So I had to eat them. [his stomach is shown to have a rectangular shape from his eaten painting. Squidward starts to cry out a fountain of tears into SpongeBob. SpongeBob soaks it up and becomes bigger, but he squishes himself to let the water out] 
SpongeBob: There, there. You can come live with me. [shown at SpongeBob's house] Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed. [Squidward is laying in SpongeBob's bed] 
Squidward: Okay, but just until I get a job. One day... two days tops. 
SpongeBob: [baby talk] Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to. [kisses Squidward on his nose] Good night, my little angel. [the next morning, SpongeBob rings a bell to wake Squidward] Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you. 
Squidward: And in bed, too? Aw, thanks, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I... 
SpongeBob: Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane. [makes plane noises while attempting to put some food in Squidward's mouth with a spoon] 
Squidward: It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need. [swallows the food] I'll try not to be a burden. 
SpongeBob: It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner? 
Squidward: No, no, no. You've already... well... [shows SpongeBob putting lotion on his hand and then massaging Squidward's scalp, feeding him grapes, massaging his tentacle, spraying his scalp with hairspray and wiping it, massaging his back then his nose, giving him a baby bottle, wiping his scalp once more, giving him an acupuncture, and polishing his head and seeing his reflection] 
SpongeBob: Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. [throws the blanket upwards and it lands on him as he lies on the sofa] I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good. [turns the lamp off then yawns] Good night, Gary. 
Squidward: SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water? [bottom floor light turns on and SpongeBob marches up stairs and turns on the light to give Squidward the water] Thank you. 
SpongeBob: Good night. [marches back down stairs and turns off the light] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets? [SpongeBob marches upstairs again turning on the lights on the way up there] 
SpongeBob: Here you go. 
Squidward: Thank you. [SpongeBob goes downstairs again, accidentally leaving Squidward's light on] SpongeBob, you forgot to turn out the light! [SpongeBob marches upstairs] 
SpongeBob: Good night. [turns off light and when he walks downstairs he trips and makes lots of noises] 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me. 
Narrator: Three weeks later... 
SpongeBob: [exhausted] He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back. [falls down] 
Narrator: Many months later... 
SpongeBob: [even more exhausted. Gary looks tired as well] I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough. [falls down] 
New Narrator: So much later that the old narrator got tired of waiting and they had to hire a new one... 
[SpongeBob drags himself into the room, by now utterly exhausted. Gary doesn't look sympathetic, though.] 
Gary: Meow, meow, meow. 
SpongeBob: [annoyed] I know he still isn't looking for work! Don't rub it in!
Squidward: SpongeBob, where's my lemonade? 
SpongeBob: Coming, Squidward. [He falls flat on his face] 
Squidward: [SpongeBob is running down the hallway] SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob enters his bedroom] And why aren't you in uniform? [SpongeBob exits room and re-enters in a maid outfit] It's about time you got here! 
SpongeBob: [sardonically] Here you go, Your Majesty. 
Squidward: I can't drink that. 
SpongeBob: Why not? 
Squidward: Are you blind? Just look at it. [close-up of the lemonade] 
SpongeBob: [becomes irritated] What about it? 
Squidward: That lemon has three seeds in it. That's an odd number! I can't eat anything odd numbered. 
SpongeBob: Fine, I'll just take it out. [takes out lemon and Squidward gets mad] 
Squidward: No! No! It's already contaminated by the bad lemon! It won't work! 
SpongeBob: Hmm, that's two things in this house that won't work. 
Squidward: Then go fix them. 
SpongeBob: [grips the glass of lemonade so hard that it shatters] Two things that won't work! [clenches his fists in anger] 
Squidward: I've changed my mind. I want soup instead. 
SpongeBob: Okay. Don't move. [walks out the bedroom door, revealing his white briefs. He then closes the door, and comes back in wearing normal clothes with a bowl of steaming soup] Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it special. [shows soup with the phrase "GET A JOB" in alphabet letters but then Squidward slaps it out of SpongeBob's hands] 
Squidward: Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting! Now you've ruined my appetite! Go fetch me something to read! 
SpongeBob: Oh, okay. How about this? [pulls out a newspaper with the "job listings" page on the front] 
Squidward: [gasps and swats the newspaper away. SpongeBob becomes more angry] Get that away from me! You know I'm allergic to newsprint! 
SpongeBob: [chortles] Ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did... at his job! [SpongeBob's alarm blows him away] 
Squidward: 4:00. Time for my stories. Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around. [SpongeBob rolls in a TV and hands Squidward the remote. Squidward turns it on to see two puppets: one green puppet and one lime green puppet wearing a shirt and tie] 
Puppet #1: [puppet #2 is whistling] Hey, where are you going? 
Puppet #2: To my job. 
Puppet #1: You have a job? 
Puppet #2: Why wouldn't I? I'm not some lazy, inconsiderate jerk who lays in bed all day. 
Puppet #1: Say, where can I get one of these... jobs? 
Puppet #2: Oh, they're everywhere. [we see SpongeBob playing with the puppets] Especially if you're green and have six tentacles. 
Puppet #1: Thanks. I'm gonna go look for one so I can stop... 
SpongeBob: ...mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives! 
Squidward: This isn't my show. [presses the remote, but nothing happens] SpongeBob, the remote control is broken! Get over here and fix it! 
SpongeBob: I've got a better idea! [throws the TV away and jumps on top of Squidward in bed] Why don't I call someone whose job it is to fix it? You know why? Because when I need a job [pokes Squidward's nose] done I get someone with a job [pokes Squidward's nose] to do [pokes Squidward's nose] that JOB! [pokes Squidward's nose for the fourth time] 
Squidward: [narrows his eyelids] What are you saying? 
[This turns out to be the last straw. Outside, it is day. SpongeBob's house jumps into the air before the side is smashed out as an enraged SpongeBob pushes the bed, with Squidward still in it, outside and towards the Krusty Krab while screaming in extreme and total fury.] 
Mr. Krabs: [talking on his phone] Donate to the children's fund? Why? What have children ever done for me? [SpongeBob grabs phone and throws it away] 
SpongeBob: You want your dime back?! [takes one out] Take it! Now Squidward can come back, right? [Mr. Krabs checks the dime through a telescope] 
Mr. Krabs: Wrong! [throws the dime at SpongeBob's face] That ain't my first dime. 
SpongeBob: Then have some more dimes! [throws out more dimes at Mr. Krabs' face. Mr. Krabs narrows his eyes] I've got plenty of 'em! 
Mr. Krabs: You can't put a price on me first dime! And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat, Squidward for stealing it! 
SpongeBob: [finally snapping in extreme rage, he grabs Mr. Krabs by the throat and holds him up in the air] Listen, you crustaceous cheapskate! Squidward's been living at my house driving me crazy! [shakes him vigorously] AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HIRE HIM BACK ALL BECAUSE OF A STUPID DIME?! [a prehistoric dime falls out of Mr. Krabs' back pocket. SpongeBob suddenly calms down and lets go of Mr. Krabs] What's that? 
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Me first dime. [hugs the dime] Oh, Dimey, I'll never lose you again. 
SpongeBob: This is a dime? 
Mr. Krabs: I've been in business a long time, boy. 
SpongeBob: So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right? 
Mr. Krabs: Aye, lad, just let the dime and me have our privacy. [kisses the dime. SpongeBob cheers before running off] 
Mr. Krabs: [at the counter] Well, Mr. Squidward, it's good to have ya back. 
Squidward: Well, it's kind of good to be back, sir. 
Mr. Krabs: It's all water under the bridge now. 
Squidward: I agree, sir. 
Mr. Krabs: After all, I'm sure ya didn't mean to misplace me dime. 
Squidward: What the... What are you saying? 
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's obvious that ya put the dime in me pants. Dimes just don't fly into people's pants. 
Squidward: Are you accusing me of something? [SpongeBob puts the maid costume back on over his clothes] 
Mr. Krabs: Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you put the dime in me pants. [outside the Krusty Krab] Two, you put the dime in me pants. Or three—you put the dime in me pants!
Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious oasis of sand and sea. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy next to a tent]
Sandy: Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?
SpongeBob: Ah, yes. How foolish of me. [cackles] Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit. [goes into the tent, then pokes his head out] And I won't do anything else. [goes back in]
Sandy: SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah! [puts on his headgear that was in the bag] Hi-yah! [puts on his karate gloves that was in the bag] Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! [kicks the bag]
Sandy: SpongeBob, are you ready?
SpongeBob: Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready! [softly] Ready to get it on. [jumps out of the tent towards Sandy] Hi...
Sandy: Hi-yah! [kicks SpongeBob in his mouth] Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear.
SpongeBob: [muffled laughter] Great minds think alike, I suppose.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops him into the air. SpongeBob crashes into the ground, followed by his pants, socks, and shoes. He stands up with the clothing on his head and feet in some food]
SpongeBob: I may be down, but I'm not out! [looks down at his feet, which are in some potato salad at a family picnic]
Tom: Way to go, buddy. It took us three days to make that potato salad. [SpongeBob jumps away] Three days!
SpongeBob: [jumps into an empty area] Hi-yah! Sandy?
Sandy: Oh, I'm Sandy, alright. [her arms come out of the ground and squish SpongeBob's face] I'm very Sandy. [kicks SpongeBob into the air] Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it. She's "Sandy." That's her name; she's also covered in... yes! [flies out of the water then back into it. Scene cuts to Sandy talking to an ice cream vendor]
Sandy: Back in Texas, we call ice cream "frozen cow juice". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob in the face with her karate glove] Thank you.
Ice Cream Vendor: No, no, thank you.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob again, sending him into the air and flying into a strong fish that is waiting in line]
Tough Fish #1: [growls] Who threw that piece of paper at me? [SpongeBob stammers and whistles]
Sandy: Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?
Tough Fish #1: Ahoy, fair lass, it be the line to get into the Salty Spitoon — [points over to an old building] the roughest, toughest sailor club ever to be built under the seven seas. Only the baddest of the bad can get in. You need to have muscles. [flexes his arm] You need to have muscles on your muscles. [flexes, even more, created more muscles on his previous ones] You need to have muscles on your eyeballs! [flexes his eyes, creating muscles]
SpongeBob: Ew. [a fish is screaming while flying out of the Salty Spitoon]
Sandy: Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah, let's go in.
Reg: [lets a fish walk in] Go ahead. [line moves up] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Tough Fish #1: How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning!
Reg: Yeah, so?
Tough Fish #1: Without any milk.
Reg: Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. [tough fish walks in. Sandy walks up to Reg] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Sandy: How tough am I? [rips off one of his tattoos that says "MOM" and puts it upside down back where it was. Reg screams in pain when Sandy rips off the tattoo]
SpongeBob: Wow.
Sandy: Got any more tattoos? [Reg covers the upside down tattoo with his arms]
Reg: Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead.
Sandy: Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob! [walks in]
Reg: How tough are ya?
SpongeBob: How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
Reg: Sure. [hands the bottle of ketchup to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It's on! [strains to open it, but he can't] If I could just run this under some hot water...
Reg: Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man.
SpongeBob: Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
Reg: Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place. [points to the building across the street]
SpongeBob: Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg: Uhh. Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it. [points to another building]
SpongeBob: Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg: Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in a seat at Weenie Hut Jr's]
Nerd #1: How's your collection coming along?
Nerd #2: Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty sweet. I'm in the process of acquiring issue 347 which will give me my fourth complete set.
Nerd #1: No...
SpongeBob: [snorts] What weenies. Oh, brother.
Robot: [robotic voice] Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?
SpongeBob: What? But I'm not a weenie! [the robot scans SpongeBob with one of its scanners]
Robot: I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie. [computer beeps and shows a picture of a hot dog weenie with the word "YES" below it]
SpongeBob: That's impossible! [the two nerds look at him. He runs off]
Robot: You can't hide what's inside.
SpongeBob: [runs over to Reg] I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie! [a strong, orange fish walks up]
Tough Fish #4: Hey, Reg, how's it going? [SpongeBob screams in surprise and he jumps onto Reg's arms.]
Reg: You were sayin'? [to orange fish] Go ahead, buddy.
Tough Fish #4: Thanks, Reg. [walks in]
SpongeBob: So, your name's Reg?
Reg: [throws SpongeBob aside] Would you get outta here?
SpongeBob: Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will! [runs off. Scene cuts to Weenie Hut Jr's]
Nerd #1: Couldn't get in, huh? What you need is a tough hairdo. No one gets into the Double S without a tough hairdo.
Nerd #2: I disagree, I saw a guy going in there and he was bald.
Nerd #1: I saw that guy. He wasn't bald. He had a shaved head. Shaved — that's a hairdo. Case closed. [both fish notice SpongeBob is gone] Hey, where'd he go?
Robot: I believe he said something about going to the wig store.
Nerd #1: Ha-ha! Check and mate. [Someone who looks like SpongeBob walks over to Reg with a cool, black wig on]
Drifter: What's shakin', my man?
Reg: Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?
Drifter: Doubt it — I'm a drifter — just blew into town. Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out.
Reg: Nice try, kid. I know it's you.
Drifter: What're you talking about? [Reg pulls Drifter's hair, but it is still attached to his head, it's real hair]
Reg: Aha! [the hair does not come off. SpongeBob walks up with a clown wig on]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody, what's goin' on? [the Drifter gets angry as Reg tries to redo his hair, but can't do it]
Reg: Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that. [Drifter angrily walks in] Well, what do you want?
SpongeBob: I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order. [Reg takes the wig off SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob laughs nervously] So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate? [a big, green fish walks up with a tattoo of a seahorse on his right arm]
Tough Fish #5: Hey-ya, Reg.
Reg: Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink.
Tough Fish #5: Thanks. Hey, look what I can make it do. [moves his arm, which makes the seahorse tattoo wiggle]
Reg: [chuckles] Yeah. Hey, what about that one? [big, green fish looks at his left arm that has a SpongeBob tattoo on it]
Tough Fish #5: Huh, you know, I don't remember getting this one.
Reg: Can you make it dance?
Tough Fish #5: Well, here, let me try. [moves his arm. SpongeBob dances]
Reg: Hmmm, wait a minute. [rips SpongeBob off his arm] Go ahead in. [the tattoo fish walks in, rubbing his left arm]
Tough Fish #5: Yeah, sure, Reg. Thanks.
Reg: Nice try, little man. [throws SpongeBob to the back of the line behind two strong fish]
Tough Fish #6: Hey, I was in front of you!
Tough Fish #7: No, you weren't!
Tough Fish #6: You callin' me a liar?
Tough Fish #7: I ain't callin' you for dinner! [two start fighting. SpongeBob tries to run away, but the fight goes downhill, with him in it. Reg walks over]
Reg: Hold it, you two! That's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in.
Tough Fish #6: Alright!
Tough Fish #7: Thanks, Reg. [both run off as SpongeBob comes out from under the sand]
SpongeBob: Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap. [He dusts his clothes using his hands]
Reg: [chortles] I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk.
SpongeBob: Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. [spins his legs, then his hands, and then cracks his fingers, but they are snapped in half. The scene cuts out to SpongeBob’s broken fingers. He starts to cry and runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob with his fingers in a bowl of ice cream, whimpering]
Robot: Care for another sundae, weenie?
SpongeBob: [jumps angrily] I am not a weenie!
Nerd #1: Relax, you're among friends. [raises his drink]
SpongeBob: My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's. [scroll over to Patrick in the seat next to him]
Patrick: You tell 'em, SpongeBob! [sips his drink]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what're you doing here?
Patrick: I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.
Nerd #1: Actually, they moved Double Weenie Wednesday to Friday.
Nerd #2: And besides, today's Monday.
Patrick: Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?
Nerd #1: Uhh, that's now on Sunday.
Patrick: Barnacles!
Nerd #2: Super Weenie Hut Jr's has a Mega Weenie Monday.
Nerd #1: Uhh, no, you're thinking of Monster Weenie Monday.
SpongeBob: I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon! [begins to walks out]
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.
SpongeBob: I've got no choice.
Robot: I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?
Patrick: Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!
Patrick: Yeah! [both run out]
Nerd #1: Hey, how come you never help us out with our problems?
Robot: I am a robot, not a miracle worker. [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Reg]
SpongeBob: Afternoon, Reg.
Reg: Whoa, whoa, little man. You still can't go in.
SpongeBob: Well, that makes me pretty mad.
Reg: Oh yeah?
SpongeBob: Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
Reg: [sarcastically] Wow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.
Reg: Hmmm... what about that guy? [points to a large muscular fish behind him]
SpongeBob: [gasps and stammers] I, uh... [laughs] don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy! [points to Patrick]
Patrick: Who, me? [SpongeBob walks up to Patrick]
SpongeBob: Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!
Patrick: Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh... [looks at his hand, which has writing on it] ...kickboxer. [winks and gives a thumbs-up to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! [Patrick starts to tear up]
Patrick: Tubby? [Patrick's sadness is quickly replaced by fury and he snarls with rage] Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby! [punches SpongeBob in the eye, leaving a black mark]
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?
Patrick: Oh yeah. [invisible punches flying] No, please wait. [grunting as more invisible punches hit him and an elephant sound is heard when Patrick's head is hit. Patrick is being thrown into the air and on the ground, then given a wedgie] No, please, have mercy! [Patrick is kicked into the background]
Reg: Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him. [Patrick is still getting beaten in the background]
SpongeBob: I did?
Reg: I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in.
SpongeBob: Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life! [walks in as Reg smiles. Scene cuts to an ambulance driving down the street with SpongeBob in bandages and Sandy by his side] Sandy? [groans] What happened?
Sandy: You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube. [ambulance arrives at the hospital. Scene cuts to Sandy wheeling SpongeBob in front of the doctor]
Doctor: What happened?
SpongeBob: I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.
Doctor: Boo-boos, eh? Hmmm... I think you guys want that hospital. [points across the street to Weenie Hut General]
SpongeBob: Weenie Hut General?
Squidward: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [looking at his watch while SpongeBob is mopping the floor] I'm done with my shift, Mr. Krabs! And let me just say, there will come a day when I will make something of my life and I will never have to set foot in this grease trap again! [Real-life footage of a cheering crowd appears behind Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward. [crowd disappears]
Squidward: Okay. [walks out of the Krusty Krab]
Squilliam: [talking to a group of people] So, I just took my private yacht across my private lake to my private heliport. It's the only way off my private island.
Squidward: [gasps] Oh, shrimp! It's my arch rival from high school, Squilliam Fancyson! I can't let him see me in my Krusty Krab uniform. [takes off his hat and is about to put it in the trashcan]
Squilliam: On your lunch break, eh, Squiddy?
Squidward: Yes... I mean no... I mean... uhh, uhh... Hey, whatcha been up to?
Squilliam: Oh, just succeeding in everything you've failed in.
Squidward: You are no great shakes, Squilliam Fancyson. Anyone can be a big shot in a hick town like Bikini Bottom.
Squilliam: Oh, is that so? Let's hear what you've accomplished since high school, Squiddy.
Squidward: [thinking to himself] Don't be intimidated, Squidward. Try to imagine him in his underwear. [imagines Squilliam as a hot underwear model] Oh, no, he's hot! [to Squilliam] I'm, uhh, in... food service.
Squilliam: Hold it, don't tell me. You're a cashier! [laughs. His group laughs with him]
Squidward: [thinking to himself] Don't lie. Lying always makes it worse. [to Squilliam] I own a five-star restaurant!
Squilliam: [as the crowd gasps] Squidward, I had no idea you were such a success.
Squidward: That's right.
Squilliam: And I would be honored if you would allow me to come to your restaurant tonight. [Sound of glass breaking. Squidward's nose shrivels up in extreme shock]
Squidward: T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?
Squilliam: In fact, we'll all come. My treat! [group cheers. Scene cuts to Squidward in Mr. Krabs' office]
Squidward: Please, Mr. Krabs, you got to help me! When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boo-hoo! Let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin. [rubs his fingers and music plays]
Squidward: This is serious.
Mr. Krabs: I know. This really is the world's smallest violin. [tiny violin is shown] See?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Please let me run the restaurant for just one night! I really need to impress Squilliam.
Mr. Krabs:  Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam? [Squilliam's unibrow appears above Mr. Krabs' head] That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?
Squidward: Don't rub it in.
Mr. Krabs: Why didn't you tell me? We'll take him to the cleaners.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs standing straight in a line. Squidward is walking back and forth in a white tuxedo.]
Squidward: Alright, listen up. Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes. Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible. [Patrick appears next to SpongeBob with an army hat on his head] Patrick, what are you doing here?
Patrick: I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!
Squidward: The Corps? What the... Pat, this isn't the... oh! [sighs] Beggars can't be choosers. Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?
Patrick: You mean like a weenie? Okay! [talks like a weenie] May I take your hat, sir? May I take your hat, sir? May I...
Squidward: [shuts Patrick up] Alright, I've heard enough. You've got the job. [walks off] Mr. Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S.S. Gourmet?
Mr. Krabs: Aye-aye!
Squidward: Then you'll be our chef. [Mr. Krabs walks off]
SpongeBob: What can I do?
Squidward: I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Squidward: It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders.
SpongeBob: Do other restaurants do that?
Squidward: Yes, they do that! Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this. [hands SpongeBob a book]
SpongeBob: "How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes." Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!
Squidward: Alright, I've got all the positions filled. I just might pull this off!
Patrick: Gimme that hat! [shaking a coat rack with a hat on it] I said give it to me! Are you gonna hand it over or not? Don't you back-sass me! [jumps on the coat rack and starts punching it]
Squidward: He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential! [an explosion in the kitchen is heard. A bunch of green goop flies out] What happened? What is it?
Mr. Krabs: Peas! [a can of peas, still in the can, is on the stove and is on fire] Made 'em the old-fashioned way.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, you gotta take them out of the... [gasps] Holy fish paste, what is that?! [notices a giant goop pile of food on the grill, with flies and other things sticking out of it]
Mr. Krabs: That's the appetizer.
Squidward: But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?
Mr. Krabs: Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea. [Squidward walks out of the kitchen]
Squidward: There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me! [walks over to SpongeBob] Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob? [turns SpongeBob around. SpongeBob looks like a zombie, tired from reading all the pages]
SpongeBob: I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Every sentence, every paragraph... [slams the book on his face between each word] Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?! [brain starts to swell] My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode! [he explodes]
Squidward: SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax. [SpongeBob lowers his arms] Little more. [SpongeBob lowers his arms more] Little more. [SpongeBob's face falls to the floor] Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.
SpongeBob: Empty my mind?
Squidward: Empty your mind.
SpongeBob: Empty my mind...
Squidward: Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing. [inside SpongeBob's head, we see a bunch of smaller SpongeBobs working on computers in an office]
Smaller SpongeBob #1: [Runs into the office] Just got an order from the boss: Dump everything that isn't about fine dining!
Other Smaller SpongeBobs: Everything?
SpongeBob #1: Everything! [everyone starts to panic and start throwing everything away] Come on, come on, come on! Bring 'em, bring 'em, bring 'em! Jellies, jellies! [Another smaller SpongeBob shreds papers marked "Jellyfishing" then "Childhood memories" then "Spice Garden Tips] Let's go, let's go! Keep doing it! [walking towards another smaller SpongeBob] Come on, let's get moving! [talking to a smaller SpongeBob] Hurry up! What do you think I'm paying you for?
Smaller SpongeBob #2: You don't pay me. We don't even exist. We're just a clever visual metaphor used to personify the abstract concept of thought.
Smaller SpongeBob #1: One more crack like that and you're out of here!
Smaller SpongeBob #2: No, please! I have three kids! [more dumping persists. Scene cuts back to SpongeBob, with a blank look on his face]
Squidward: How do you feel? [cuts to SpongeBob, still with a blank face] SpongeBob? [snaps his tentacles as SpongeBob drools] This isn't working! [Patrick is walking on all fours with the coat rack in his mouth] I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time! [runs out the door] I'll just go to Squilliam's house and... [stops because he sees Squilliam and the group] Squilliam, you're here!
Squilliam: Hello, Squiddy! [Squidward steps back] We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant.
Squidward: Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!
Squilliam: Explain what? That you, Squidward Tentacles, voted most likely to suck eggs in high school, [walks in] are trying to pass off a lousy burger stand as a five-star... [gulps] ...restaurant!? [inside of the restaurant looks very professional with nice wallpaper, an orchestra, a chandelier, and other things] Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina... [Squidward joins in chanting "Hommina" and then the group comes in and starts to chant "Hommina" as well. SpongeBob comes in with a tuxedo on]
SpongeBob: Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately! [picks up the group of customers with one hand]
Squidward: [whispering] How did you do all this?
SpongeBob: It was easy, once I cleared my mind.
Squidward: But what about Krabs and Patrick?
SpongeBob: Taken care of. [Mr. Krabs and Patrick are tied up and gagged in the back] Right this way, please. [seats everyone quickly. Then Squilliam is seated without a chair at first, but SpongeBob then rushes back to give his a chair to sit on] Good evening, sir. [gives Squilliam a menu] From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg? [gives Squilliam a shoulder massage as he takes away his menu. As he explains what Squilliam is eating, he gives him a napkin to put on his neck and feeds him the dinner] We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank. [While telling him all of this, he makes Squilliam's experience the best he can so he treats him like royalty doing all sorts of things]
Squilliam: Mmm... this is fantastic!
SpongeBob: [salutes with all the hands that helped] Thank you, sir.
Squidward: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [SpongeBob pinches him with a pin] Ow!
SpongeBob: If you need anything else, just call.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!
SpongeBob: Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do. [takes a deep breath and runs off]
Squidward: It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face. [SpongeBob is combing Squilliam's unibrow] Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.
Squilliam: [his eyes tear up] Alright, I admit it. Everything is fabulous. The food, the atmosphere! Everything's flawless!
Squidward: In that case, I need you to read this. [hands Squilliam a card]
Squilliam: Uhh, "Squidward Tentacles..."
Squidward: [puts a foam finger with words "#1 Squid" on his left hand] And I need you to wear this.
Squilliam: Oh, eh, "Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest..."
Squidward: [puts a microphone in front of Squilliam] I'm sorry, one more time. [Squilliam's voice is over the loudspeaker]
Squilliam: "Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest restaurant in Bikini Bottom... and he does not suck eggs." [everyone cheers] Squidward, I must tell you... [SpongeBob pours more water in Squilliam's glass and he drinks it] Thank you. What really won me over was your brilliant waiter. It's as if all he knows is fine dining... and breathing. I must know your name. [record scratches]
SpongeBob: My name?
Squilliam: Yes, your name, son.
SpongeBob: Uhh... Beef Wellington?
Squilliam: [chuckles] No, your name.
SpongeBob: Uhh... err... the fork on the left?
Squidward: Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.
SpongeBob: My name? [zoom inside of SpongeBob's brain again where all the SpongeBob's are searching for a name]
Smaller SpongeBob #3: [as he checks file cabinets] What's his name?! What's his name?! I've got nothing on a name!
Smaller SpongeBob #4: [pressing a key on a keyboard connected to a computer] Come on, baby, what's the name?!? [The computer bursts into flames. Panicked shouting is heard from other smaller SpongeBobs as they are running around while papers are flying]
Smaller SpongeBob #5: We threw out his name! [More smaller SpongeBobs begin to run around while more papers are flying. SpongeBob's brain then breaks in half. Cuts back to Squilliam and Squidward with SpongeBob stammering for a moment. Then he splashes water on Squilliam and then starts to bark.]
Squidward: I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that... [he screams as he notices SpongeBob with a bowl of hot soup by Fred]
SpongeBob: More soup for your armpit? [holds up Fred's arm and throws the soup on his armpits]
Fred: [screams in pain]
SpongeBob: [he runs over to Martha and grabs her head] Please enjoy the food! [slams her face into her food then runs up to Nat] Would you like some cheese on that, sir? [pulls out a cheese grater, picks him up and grates his butt with it as Nat screams. Everyone screams and panics]
Squidward: No! Nooo! [Patrick, still tied up, runs out of the kitchen, screaming. Mr. Krabs, still tied up, runs out also.]
Mr. Krabs: Run for your lives, everyone! It's the appetizer! [the appetizer, which has now come to life, bursts through the door and roars. Mr. Krabs is sent flying. Everyone screams and panics. They crash through the windows and the door, running away. Squidward's tuxedo rips in half by itself and falls off, and his Krusty Krab hat and name tag land on him in their proper places. The name tag reads "Squidward Tentacles, Cashier"]
Squilliam: Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting.
Squidward: [his eyes tear up] Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!
Squilliam: Squidward, I understand. I have a confession to make myself. I made everything up about my life. I have no yachts, jets, or anything. I was only trying to impress you. The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier, too! [He starts to cry and Mr. Krabs plays the violin]
Squidward: Is that true?
Squilliam: Of course not! I'm filthy stinking rich! Come on, everyone. Let's all take a ride in my ballooncasino! [everyone cheers and follows Squilliam. The wallpaper in the Krusty Krab rips off. Squidward sits down and sighs]
SpongeBob: [walks by with a bag of ice on his head] Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?
Squidward: Oh, the usual. [Mr. Krabs slides over and plays the violin] Would you get out of here!? [fade to black, ending the episode]
TV: [SpongeBob is watching the movie while eating popcorn] We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot.
Dan Povenmire: [screaming while being chased by a giant robot]
SpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on. 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out. [scene cuts to SpongeBob lying in his bed, whimpering and shivering] What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary? [Gary is sleeping] Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear? [pokes Gary's eye, causing him to wake up] 
Gary: Meow! 
SpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right? 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep. [goes to sleep. Dreams about running from the giant robot from the movie earlier. Scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab, with SpongeBob in the kitchen, panting] Robot! Oh my gosh! [robot turns out to be a sack of potatoes, a dust pan and broom, and a bucket] Huh? [chuckles nervously. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs holding down his money on his office desk] 
Mr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to? [turns on the radio that is next to him] 
Radio DJ:  [From the radio] And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: "Electric Zoo." [techno beat is heard. Mr. Krabs starts counting his money] 
Mr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music. [scene cuts to the kitchen. A buzzer goes off] 
SpongeBob: I surrender! Oh. 
Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams. His hat flies onto Squidward's nose] 
SpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose? 
Squidward: [removes the hat from his nose and puts it back on SpongeBob's head] I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order! 
SpongeBob: #17 -- [holds up a tray with food] Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh? 
Squidward: [sarcastically] Hilarious. Just deliver the food. 
SpongeBob: [delivers the food to Thaddeus] There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you? 
Thaddeus: No, I'm not. 
SpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled. [in a deep voice] They're everywhere. Back to work! [he runs away, Thaddeus shrugs his shoulders. SpongeBob walks by Mr. Krabs' office] 
Mr. Krabs: [from office] I feel completely recharged! 
SpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs. [peeks in the window] 
Mr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again. [shakes his radio] Please? One more time, for me. 
SpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels "recharged." [laughs] If I didn't know better, I'd say he was... [scene zooms in on SpongeBob] ...a robot! Nah. 
Mr. Krabs: [calls the radio station] Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again. 
Radio DJ: [From the phone] Hmmm... which one, man? 
Mr. Krabs: The one that goes "bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep." 
Radio DJ: No, man. You're thinking of "bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bop." 
Mr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop, [Garbly telephone noise] bee-boo-boo-bop, [Garbly telephone noise] boo-boo-bee-bop? [Garbly telephone noise] Not bee-boo-boo-beep? [Garbly telephone noise] Bop? [Garbly telephone noise] Beep?! [Garbly telephone noise] Boo-boo-bop?! [SpongeBob screams] 
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot? Nah. [peeks into the window again and sees Mr. Krabs doing a robot dance on his desk. He jumps onto Squidward's arms] Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot! 
Squidward: [picks up SpongeBob off his arms] That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen! [throws him in the kitchen. Squidward laughs, but SpongeBob reappears beside him. Squidward is confused and looks around for how he did it] 
SpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too. 
Squidward: [confused] How did you...? 
SpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter] What is it, boy? 
SpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it. 
Mr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious? 
Squidward: Umm... yeah, sure. 
Mr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad. 
SpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward? 
Squidward: [chuckles nervously] Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie? 
Mr. Krabs: Why? 
Squidward: It was rated "Arr!"[laughing] Arr! Because it's... about... pirates. 
Mr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot! 
Squidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you... 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What? What is it, boy? 
SpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? [pretends to cry] 
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work! 
SpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either. 
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much! 
SpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love. 
Squidward: No, wait, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What is it, SpongeBob?! 
SpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! [Mr. Krabs makes a blank expression on his face] 
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward. 
SpongeBob: [gulps] Squidward? [Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing something when the radio stops working. Radio breaks with electronic breakage sound effect.] 
Mr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died! [takes out the batteries] Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas. [puts the batteries in his back pocket. A bell rings and then Mr. Krabs walks over to a pot of boiling water] Me hard-boiled egg is ready! [picks up a pair of tongs] I can already taste it. Come to Papa. [takes the egg out of the water with his tongs] Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? [picks up a salt shaker] 
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [breaks the egg and accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes] Ahhh! Oh, my eyes! [starts screaming] 
SpongeBob: Mr... [Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth] 
Squidward: Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like? 
SpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries. 
Squidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?! 
Mr. Krabs: [Barges out screaming; his eyes are piercing red, his pair of the tongs snip, then it shows the batteries in his pocket] 
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: [both screaming]
Mr. Krabs: [continues screaming as he goes into the bathroom] 
Squidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy! 
SpongeBob: [runs over to the phone] Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy! 
Operator: Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service. 
SpongeBob: Squidward, the robots are running the Navy! 
Squidward: Not the Navy! [over loudspeaker] Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! [everyone is silent] Our world! [all the customers run out screaming] What do we do now? 
SpongeBob: I don't know! [notices a nickel] Hey, a nickel! [he points at it] 
Squidward: SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob: Sorry. 
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the bathroom, his eyes back to normal] Ah, that's better. [walks back to his office] Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop. 
Squidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how? 
SpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot. 
Squidward: They poop on the robot? 
SpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information. 
Squidward: I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! [grabs the book titled “How To Torture” and reads it with SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs some rope while Squidward grabs a hammer and a saw. SpongeBob also grabs some old comedy records. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where SpongeBob &amp; Squidward enter] 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys. [they are at the door with angry expressions on their faces] What can I do for you? [SpongeBob &amp; Squidward lock the door] Heh-heh, why did you lock the door? [nervously as they slowly and menacingly approach him] Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?! [shot of outside the Krusty Krab where loud crashing and everyone screaming can be heard. Back in the office, Squidward ties Mr. Krabs to his office chair] SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!
Squidward: Shut up! [slaps Mr. Krabs] 
Mr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?! 
Squidward: I said "shut up!," you bucket of bolts! [slaps him again] 
SpongeBob: I can't take it! [runs off, crying] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you okay? 
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch! 
Squidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs. [Mr. Krabs is trying to get out of his chair] 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. 
Squidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know. 
SpongeBob: Right. [runs up to Mr. Krabs and then slaps him] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first. 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? [slaps him again] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this. [turns a light on Mr. Krabs] Where's Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: [confused] What are you talkin' about? I'm Mr. Krabs. [Squidward slaps him again] 
Squidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs. 
SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs. 
Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! 
SpongeBob: This is one stubborn robot. 
Mr. Krabs: [confused, then angrily yells] WHAT?! [his yelling knocks over the light and SpongeBob] YOU THINK I'M A ROBOT?! 
Squidward: We don't think; we know. 
Mr. Krabs: That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs! 
Squidward: [walks over to SpongeBob] He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way. 
SpongeBob: I got an idea. [pokes Squidward's nose] Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robo tricks. [runs out and returns later] If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. [holds up a blender] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender. 
SpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his "little buddy." 
Squidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob. 
Mr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy. 
Squidward: We're just gonna see what your "little buddy" knows. [SpongeBob sets the blender on Mr. Krabs' desk. Squidward holds up a bat] 
Mr. Krabs: [panicking] No, wait! What are you going to do to me blender?! That cost me money! 
Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? [shot of the blender] Not talking, eh? [breaks the blender with the bat] 
Mr. Krabs: No! That cost me $24.95! 
SpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything. 
Squidward: Go get the toaster. [SpongeBob gets the toaster then puts it on Mr. Krabs' desk] 
Mr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50! [Squidward breaks the toaster and then SpongeBob sets a food processor on the desk] $62.67! [Squidward breaks it with the bat. SpongeBob picks up a coffee maker and puts it on the desk] Four... well, actually, that one was a gift. [Squidward breaks it] Nooo! 
SpongeBob: [while trying to put the cash register on Mr. Krabs' desk] This is the last robot, Squidward. 
Mr. Krabs: No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator. [crying] No! [sobbing and then sobbing louder] 
Squidward: I thought you said robots can't cry. 
SpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love. 
Mr. Krabs: [crying] I loved it like it was me own. 
SpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing. 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! [sobbing] 
Squidward: SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end? 
SpongeBob: The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... [slows down, as he realizes his mistake] imagination. [chuckles nervously, timpani noise, as if he anticipates Squidward to be angry at him, then checks his watch] Hey, it's time to feed Gary. [runs out while Squidward smiles nervously at Mr. Krabs and then grabs a broom and sweeps the broken pieces on the floor. Mr. Krabs becomes infuriated, the scene then exits from the office to the exterior of The Krusty Krab outside.] 
Mr. Krabs: [Growling, starting the background shaking] SQUIDWAAAAAAAAAARD!
SpongeBob: [runs outside to retrieve the newspaper] Gary, the paper's here! [Gary comes out on a motorized skateboard. SpongeBob gives him the paper but keeps the rubber band.] You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section! [shakes the rubber band around for emphasis. Hums while he stretches the rubber band around the middle of his body and snaps it together, turning him into a bowtie-like shape] I am a happy sponge! [runs around, laughing, while Gary is reading the paper]
Gary: [looking slightly annoyed by SpongeBob by rolling his eyes] Meow! [SpongeBob runs into Patrick, who also has a rubber band stretched around him]
Patrick: I see you got the paper. [his rubber band snaps off]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick. [then his rubber band snaps off as well. Patrick clears his throat] Well, I'd better get going.
Patrick: Yep, see you later. [both walk off but then hear a chirping sound and they both quickly run back, with their hands over their ears]
SpongeBob and Patrick: What did you say?
Patrick: Well, I didn't say anything.
SpongeBob: I didn't say anything, either.
SpongeBob and Patrick: See you later then. [both walk off again and the squeaking noise is heard again, so they both run back. This time, they are angry]
SpongeBob: [Pointing at Patrick] Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.
Patrick: Ah, but it is you [points] that is messing with me. [both look down to see the squeaking noise is coming from a shaking branch. Patrick points downward.] That's what's messing with us.
SpongeBob: It's a baby scallop.
Patrick: [lifts up his foot with a threatening look on his face, looking as though he is about to smash the scallop] I'll take care of this!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's totally helpless. [takes the baby scallop in his hands] It looks like he can't even fly yet.
Patrick: What's the matter, is he stupid?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just a baby. [close-up of the chirping scallop in SpongeBob's hands] He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
Patrick: Well, we can't just leave him out here.
SpongeBob: You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple. [both run in and set the baby scallop on the ground] Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in. [SpongeBob removes his pants and sets it in front of the scallop] There you go. It's the best seat [points to his rear] in the house. [scene cuts to Gary, who does a rimshot]
Patrick: Let me see! [Patrick sticks his whole head inside SpongeBob's pants] Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh! [takes his head out, which is now eaten on the side] I think somebody's hungry!
SpongeBob: [takes out Junior and speaks in baby-talk to it] Is it true? Are you hungry?
Junior: [chirping happily] Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!
SpongeBob: I've got just the thing. [puts Junior on a barrel and takes out a Krabby Patty] How would you like a Krabby Patty? [Junior yelps]
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
SpongeBob: Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. [shows Junior a minuscule Krabby Patty]
Junior: [sniffs the patty, then sticks his tongue out in disgust] Blech!
SpongeBob: Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. [gobbles it and gulps it down]
Patrick: [holds up a donut] Let's try a donut. [Junior hisses]
SpongeBob: [holds up a tray of French fries] French fries?
Junior: [shaking his head] Unh-unh.
Patrick: [eating the donut] A donut? [Junior blows a raspberry]
SpongeBob: [holds up an apple] All we have left is this apple. [a worm pokes its head out of the apple]
Worm: Hello, sea creatures! I bring you greetings from Apple World! [Junior chirps in excitement]
SpongeBob: Of course, scallops love worms. [picks up the worm]
Worm: Huh, wait! We will bury you! [SpongeBob drops it in Junior's mouth]
SpongeBob: Well, you should be good for the rest of the... [Junior cries]
Patrick: What now?
SpongeBob: I don't know! Aww, don't cry. [Junior is still crying]
Patrick: Do something, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo! Look at the funny face! [shows SpongeBob has a puppet that looks like him on his hand] Look at the funny face!
Patrick: Wait. I think I might know the problem. [picks up Junior and looks at him] Yep, that's it, alright. [hides it behind his back] Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new. [Junior has a diaper on]
SpongeBob: How did you know?
Patrick: How do you think? [drops his pants showing that he is wearing a diaper] And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
SpongeBob: Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
Patrick: I know, good thing there's two of us.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
Patrick: Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom.
SpongeBob: I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
Patrick: You're right. If I was a mom..., [the camera draws back to reveal Patrick's hairy, obese, unsightly form]...this would be kind of shocking. [lifts his arms, revealing armpit hair] Just call me Daddy!
Montage:
Patrick: [softly, from inside the house] It sure is cute when it's asleep.
SpongeBob: [softly, from inside the house] Yeah. [SpongeBob and Patrick watch Junior sleeping] Shh! [both tiptoe out of the room]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob? [goes to what appears to be the right side of the bed]
SpongeBob: [goes to what appears to be the left side] Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
SpongeBob: Me neither.
[scene zooms out, revealing that Patrick is sleeping on the bottom mattress and SpongeBob is sleeping on the top]
Patrick: Well, good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. [SpongeBob's mattress slams shut on top of Patrick. Scene cuts to morning] Patrick, breakfast is ready. [SpongeBob is cooking something over at the grill as Patrick walks in, noticing the bunch of food that is on the table]
Patrick: Alright. All this parenting stuff makes me hungry. [lifts the table up as all the food slides down into mouth. He burps, then pats Junior] Hey, Junior, how are you doing today? [smells an odor from Junior] SpongeBob? [adjusts his tie]
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Kid's got a stinky.
SpongeBob: [doing many chores at the same time] Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. [Patrick guzzles down the coffee as Junior begins to cry]
Patrick: [drinking coffee] Ahh. Wish I could, but I gotta get going.
SpongeBob: Going? Where are you going?
Patrick: [puts on a suit and takes his briefcase] I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
SpongeBob: You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
Patrick: I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable. [chuckles as he closes the door]
SpongeBob: Okay. [chuckles weakly. Day turns into night, and Patrick walks in and takes his jacket and hat off]
Patrick: Phew, what a day.
SpongeBob: Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby.
Patrick: Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm totally beat from work.
SpongeBob: Huh? [Patrick sits down and watches TV. A coconut "clonk" sound effect is heard.]
Patrick: [laughs] That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing the chores] Patrick, what about my break?
Patrick: Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.
SpongeBob: Uhh, okay, tomorrow.
Narrator: Tomorrow... [scene cuts to Patrick walking in at night and taking his stuff off]
Patrick: Phew, another tough day. [walks by SpongeBob, who is still doing the same chores from yesterday]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break.
Patrick: Work was a killer. I need my chair. [sits down and watches TV again]
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing chores] Patrick, I really need my...
Patrick: Tomorrow for sure.
Narrator: Tomorrow for sure... [scene cuts to a tired SpongeBob doing the same chores as Patrick walks by]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: I'll get to it eventually...
Narrator: Eventually... [scene cuts to SpongeBob still doing the chores but even more tired]
SpongeBob: Uhhh?
Patrick: Uhhh.
Narrator: Uhhh... [scene cuts to Patrick watching TV as an angry SpongeBob walks in and turns on the lights]
SpongeBob: Patrick Star, we need to talk.
Patrick: Just one more minute, I gotta...
SpongeBob: Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man! [turns off the TV]
Patrick: Hey, I'm missin' the coconut! [he gives SpongeBob an angry look]
SpongeBob: You haven't been helping at all with Junior! [pulls in baby stroller] We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
Patrick: I changed his diaper!
SpongeBob: Yeah, once.
Patrick: He's only this big. [shows with his hands on how big Junior is] How many diapers could he possibly use?
SpongeBob: [opens up a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: Oh, that's not so much.
SpongeBob: [points over to the corner of the room where there are two bags and a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: [nervously] So?
SpongeBob: [opens up the refrigerator, full of diapers] Hmmm? [pulls the cover off the couch, revealing it to be diapers] Hmmm? [tears the wallpaper off the wall, revealing a bunch of diapers behind it] Hmmm!? [points outside to a garbage truck loading a bunch of diapers into the dumpster. Patrick quivers at the sight of it]
Patrick: [his eyes fill with tears] I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh! [sobs as he looks at SpongeBob as he smiles] I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise. [scene cuts to next day]
SpongeBob: So, what's the plan for the day?
Patrick: No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal.
SpongeBob: [gives Patrick his briefcase as he departs] Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: [waving] Six o'clock.
Patrick: [waving] Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock. [cuts to a time card]
Narrator: 12:00 midnight.
[Patrick walks in with a lampshade over his head, giggling and turns on the light]
Patrick: Oh, that was some party. [SpongeBob is wearing his mother-like clothing and he gives Patrick a bitter look] Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. [SpongeBob now looks at Patrick angrily as he taps his foot] What? What?
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing.
Patrick: Oh, what a relief. [takes the lampshade off his head and puts it on SpongeBob] For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
SpongeBob: [takes the lampshade off his head] Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
Patrick: Somethin' about root beer, right?
SpongeBob: [takes a deep breath, flatly] No.
Patrick: Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.
SpongeBob: Does... [imitates Patrick in a mocking tone with a goofy look on his face] "You can take the night off, pal!" [normal voice] ...ring a bell?
Patrick: [raspberry] I don't need this. [walks outside]
SpongeBob: What?! [walks to the door] Where do you think you're going?
Patrick: [opens his rock] I'm going back to work! [gets in and closes his rock]
SpongeBob: Work?! [growls and rips off his hairpiece]
[Cut to SpongeBob, not wearing his mother-like clothing anymore, walking outside to Patrick's rock. He opens it up, and finds Patrick in his easy chair, watching TV]
Patrick: [two "clonk" sounds are heard on the TV; laughs] He got hit in the head with two coconuts!
SpongeBob: [angrily] So, this is work?
Patrick: You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote, [looks at his rear] and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase! [he pulls a briefcase out from behind his back, and opens it up to reveal that it is filled with donuts and ice cream sundaes as he angrily dumps it all over Patrick]
Patrick: [quietly but furiously] Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?
[SpongeBob is enraged. He balls his fists and fumes so hard, his entire body shakes. Then he loses his temper and goes ballistic on Patrick, and his face morphs into a stereotypical Asian face with lots of teeth.]
SpongeBob: [Screaming intensely] OVERTIME?!
[SpongeBob jumps into Patrick's rock, and they both begin to argue intensely.]
Patrick: Yeah, overtime, pal!
SpongeBob: [overlapping Patrick] Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!
Patrick: You know what that means?
SpongeBob: And that's the kind of work you're doing?
Patrick: ​It means working when you're just too tired to work!
SpongeBob: Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!
[Junior is heard beginning to chirp]
Patrick: You just keep going on working and working!
SpongeBob: ​You never help! [screams] NEVER!
[Junior's chirping intensifies, which makes the two finally stop arguing and listen to it]
Patrick: [still mad] There's that stupid noise again!
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.
[Patrick and SpongeBob see Junior teetering on the edge of the window of SpongeBob's house, ready to fly.]
Patrick: [calmly] Oh.
[All at once, Patrick and SpongeBob are struck with shock by what's really happening.]
Both: [eyes bulge in horror, screaming] JUNIOR!
[Junior jumps down the window. SpongeBob and Patrick quickly run to catch Junior but they slam on SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob then bounces out of Patrick's stomach]
SpongeBob: [Frantic] Did you catch him?!
Patrick: [looking sadly at his empty hands] No.
Both: We're bad parents! [They break down sobbing. Then they stop when they notice that chirping Junior is flying above them.]
SpongeBob: Junior? Hey, he's flying.
Patrick: I guess he's all grown up. [Junior kisses SpongeBob then flies off] Hey, what about Daddy? [Junior drops a coconut on Patrick's head for his laziness then kisses him] That's my boy.
SpongeBob: Goodbye.
Patrick: [the coconut falls down] Goodbye, Junior.
[they watch Junior fly away]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.
Patrick: This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
SpongeBob: Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.
Patrick: Yeah... Let's have another.
[SpongeBob looks shocked]
Narrator: A slow day at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out. [holds up a patty in each hand] Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become... [throws them on the floor and Patrick slides the patties across the room]
Patrick: A one-way ticket to pain! [slams into the wall by Mr. Krabs' office. Mr. Krabs' window breaks off the wall caused by the impact.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [puts down his writing]
SpongeBob: [slides while on Patrick's mouth] Heave-ho! [slams into the wall and the place shakes]
Mr. Krabs: [exits his office] What the devil fish is going on out here?! [SpongeBob is on Patrick's mouth] Time is money! And if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money! [walks up to SpongeBob] And that's just sick!
SpongeBob: But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
Mr. Krabs: What stupid barnacle told you that?
Squidward: Uhh… [nervously covers his face up with a magazine]
Mr. Krabs: Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me. [scene cuts to the three of them standing in front of Mr. Krabs' house] Now, are you men ready for your super...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Super...
Mr. Krabs: ...special...
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...special...
Mr. Krabs: [whispers] ...secret...
SpongeBob and Patrick: [whisper] ...secret...
Mr. Krabs: ...assignment?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming] Assignment?!? I beg of you, Mr. Krabs! Put us out of our misery! [SpongeBob and Patrick get worried]
Mr. Krabs: The two of you are to paint the inside of me house! [opens his front door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! [both jump out with excitement]
Mr. Krabs: But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent. [while showing paint cans, shoves cans toward SpongeBob and Patrick] It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off... [holds up two empty plaques, each with their names on it] …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job. [shuts the door with them inside his house]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, SpongeBob? [They see Mr. Krabs' wall; it is covered head to toe in memorabilia]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on. [puts his paint on the floor] Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
Patrick: [puts his paint on the floor as well] No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff.
SpongeBob: Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.
Patrick: Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!
SpongeBob: Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.
Patrick: Good, just don't pay me.
SpongeBob: First, we need to set up the tarp. [holds up a tarp]
Patrick: Tarp ahoy! [spreads the tarp on the floor, but the camera pans to reveal it's a tiny piece]
SpongeBob: We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick. [scene cuts to more tarp on the floor but not the entire floor] Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.
Patrick: That will never ever come off.
SpongeBob: And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.
Patrick: And mount them on the wall. [SpongeBob takes a screwdriver and tries opening the lid] Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob! [screaming] Careful, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [holds the lid] Patrick, the lid's already off.
Patrick: Oh. Now it's my turn! [takes out a battle ax and hits the paint can with it. SpongeBob grabs the can]
SpongeBob: I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick! [carefully opens up the lid. When he does, a paint drop bounces on the tarp]
Both: [Screaming as the paint drop bounces on a tarp. Screaming again as the drop bounces on every tarp and then back into the can]
Patrick: Well, that was a rip-off. [SpongeBob wipes sweat off]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready. [holds up his big brush] Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush. [throws the big brush to the right of him then takes another small brush and gets a hair out of his nose. Patrick gets all his hairs out of his nose on his brush. SpongeBob dips the brush into the can and then faces the wall] All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.
Narrator: One hour later...
SpongeBob: [still standing in the same spot, while sweating nervously] Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.
Narrator: Two hours later...
SpongeBob: [still standing in the same spot and sweating] I'm getting to the painting.
Narrator: Three hours later... [Fourth wall breaks between these two lines]
Patrick: [Carrying the “Three Hours Later” time card] Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.
SpongeBob: [still standing on the same spot and sweating] No problem. Here I go. [makes a line of paint going down the wall. He smiles. The paint starts going down, but SpongeBob blows it one direction then another then another until he gets a blow dryer and blows the paint off the wall. Blows the steam off the hairdryer like a gun creating a giant paint bubble] Yeah! Huh?! [notices the big paint bubble] Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!
Patrick: Oh, I know! [takes a wand, dips it in the paint then blows a big bubble] Two giant paint bubbles!
SpongeBob: Noooooo! [two giant paint bubbles merge into one] Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!
Patrick: [finds a bicycle pump and attaches it to the bubble] Nonsense! [starts pumping the bubble, inflating it further]
SpongeBob: Pat, no! [The bubble pops and the paint splatters all over the wall, covering up all the old brown spots. SpongeBob moves out of the way for the last bit of paint to splash on the wall] We did it! [checks the area] We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the-- [shocked] Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?! [Mr. Krabs' dollar on the wall has a dot of paint on it upon closer inspection. SpongeBob's eyes crack, break, and drip on the floor. He then falls over. He then wakes up and his eyes recover] We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?
Patrick: Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!
SpongeBob: That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
Patrick: I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.
SpongeBob: Okay, [takes the dollar off the wall] this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off. [tries to wipe the paint off with his tie but makes the paint even more noticeable] There! I think I got it. [notices the paint more. He becomes nervous so he wipes it more but the dollar becomes completely covered in paint. He screams]
Patrick: Oh, now I see it!
SpongeBob: This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar… [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick's butt on the wall while Mr. Krabs is enjoying some tea by the fire]
Both: [Both shriek while holding their butts]
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said this paint never comes...
Patrick: [claps his hands over SpongeBob's mouth] Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something! We must wash this paint off! [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a washing machine]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick comes out from the washing machine with the dollar, still with paint on it, in his hands; he also has a bra on his head]
Patrick: Nope. [scene cuts to SpongeBob sanding the dollar in Patrick's hand]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick's hands are gone]
Patrick: Nope.
Patrick: [scene cuts to SpongeBob squirting sulfuric acid out of a fire hose. Patrick screams in pain]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick holds up the dollar that left a hole in his body from the force of the acid, except for the part blocked by his arms]
Patrick: Nope. [scene cuts to SpongeBob banging on the dollar Patrick is holding, while Patrick is wearing a neck brace and has a black eye; behind them is a huge assortment of weapons and tools that apparently didn't work either] Oof! Oof! Oof!
SpongeBob: [holds a club] Nothing's working!
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob! We're not cavemen! [walks over to a computer] We have technology! [picks up the computer and angrily grunts as he smashes it on the dollar]
SpongeBob: It didn't work.
Patrick: [Ranting as he puts the computer down] This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...
SpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.
Patrick: I don't see where you're going with this... [takes out his wallet and pulls out a dollar] Hey, a dollar!
SpongeBob: Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no! [Patrick puts his dollar in a vending machine] Patrick! No…why did you put it... [his dollar comes out] Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry! I... [Patrick pushes it back in] Aww, Pat, no, no! [dollar comes out again] Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it! [Patrick forcefully shoves it back in again with both hands.] Oh, no-ho-oh!
Patrick: [eats a chocolate bar as he approaches an annoyed SpongeBob] Wanna bite?
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, we still have time! [looks in a mirror] Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome! [Mr. Krabs is approaching the door while singing, offscreen]
SpongeBob's reflection: You're on your own, pal. [walks away]
SpongeBob: [screams as he runs in circles around Patrick] Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea! [Mr. Krabs enters his dark house where all the lights are off]
Mr. Krabs: What the…?
SpongeBob: [stammering] We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.
Patrick: Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you. [lights turn on; they are grinning suspiciously]
Mr. Krabs: You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.
SpongeBob: Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going... [he and Patrick are about to leave]
Mr. Krabs: Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!
SpongeBob: [stops leaving as he and Patrick kneel down and beg] Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!
Patrick: [begging] Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!
Mr. Krabs: Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?
SpongeBob: [begging] It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!
Patrick: [begging] We didn't do it on purpose!
Both: [begging] Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!
Patrick: [begging] I don't want to be butt-less!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own. [wall is decorated with tiny ships] That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar... [runs over to a bunch of dolls lined up perfectly] ...rama! [Patrick and SpongeBob are confused] All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned! [straightens one of the dolls to an upright position]
Doll: Mama.
Mr. Krabs: And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go. [runs into a long pile of paintings] Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all. [takes the painting of a crying clown off] Or this one. [takes the painting of a car race off] Or this one. [takes the painting off. SpongeBob and Patrick are anxious] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes the painting of a banana off] Or this one. [takes a painting of Painty the Pirate off. SpongeBob is behind the painting he just took off]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, you know, just hanging around.
Patrick: [gives a thumbs-down] Boo!
Mr. Krabs: Get down onto the floor, boy. [SpongeBob stretches his body to the floor. Mr. Krabs is now annoyed] Alright, now you're just being silly.
SpongeBob: [Mr. Krabs takes him off the wall and throws him aside] No, No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?!
SpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: We're so sorry!
Mr. Krabs: [looks at the dollar again then looks at SpongeBob and Patrick] And then did you draw on it with crayon?! [dollar has a smiley face and two dollar signs drawn on with green crayon]
Patrick: [holding a green crayon as SpongeBob looks at him] I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it.
Mr. Krabs: All right, boys... you know what I've gotta do now?!
SpongeBob: You mean our butts?
Patrick: Can I use mine one last time? [Mr. Krabs takes the dollar and licks it. The paint comes off then Mr. Krabs puts the dollar back up on the wall]
Mr. Krabs: There we go, good as new.
Both: [They are shocked beyond belief. Stammering] But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [frowns then smiles] Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!
Mr. Krabs: Nah, I just like to mess with ya! [Laughs. SpongeBob scowls. He and Patrick glare at Mr. Krabs; they storm out in disgust. Mr. Krabs laughs so hard he spits all over the walls] The old man's still got it! [continues laughing, but the paint comes off the wall from all the spit. He finally stops laughing to see his whole place a mess] Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.
Narrator: Welcome to SpongeBob's House Party, with your host, Patchy the Pirate. There'll be punch, cookies, explosions, and a brand-new episode of SpongeBob SquarePants!
Old-time crowd: Hooray!
Narrator: Now live, from Encino, California, get ready for a warm embrace from our party host, Patchy the Pirate!
Patchy: Hey, get off my lawn! Party? [takes a party sign off his door] There ain't no party here. Go away!
Potty: Bawk, come on in!
Patchy: Hush, Potty, can't you see I'm trying to keep out the riffraff?
Potty: Riffraff? That's our television audience, barnacle breath!
Patchy: Oh, of course it is! I was just fooling! Welcome! [gasps] Say, you didn't bring SpongeBob with you, did you? I sure hope he got his invitation.
[the scene fades to SpongeBob and Patrick receiving their invitations]
SpongeBob: I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!
Patrick: Me neither.
SpongeBob: Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire. [he and Patrick throw their invitations in a camp fire and warm their hands]
Patchy: Ah, well, come on in. Let me introduce you around. This here's Minnie Mermaid. She's cooling off on account of she's been dancing her scales off, isn't that right, Minnie, huh, takin' a little breakie poo?
Minnie: No, Patchy. Actually, I'm in here because if I wasn't, I would die.
Patchy: Ha, ha! That's the spirit! [Patchy strikes his hook into Minnie's pool, causing water to spurt out. Minnie nervously tries to stop the leak]
Patchy: Huh, let's see, who else haven't you met? That's Longbeard the pirate. Hey, there Longbeard, long time no see!
Neptune: Who dares to interrupt Neptune?
Patchy: Sorry about that, Neppy. That's Neptune. [unenthusiastically] He's king of the sea. [to two guests] You kids having fun? [Kids are chuckling] He-he.. whew! Hosting a party is hard work alright. That reminds me of a time when SpongeBob was hosting a party. Hey, you kids want to see that cartoon? [camera moves up and down] You do? Well then, launch the cartoon!
[episode starts]
Narrator: Ah, the Barg'n-Mart. A consumer's paradise of brand-like items, stocked as far as the eye can see. [SpongeBob is running down the aisles trying to get to the check-out counter as soon as possible]
SpongeBob: Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!
Lou:  Uh, that's great, SpongeBob. $1.42. 
SpongeBob: But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records. [writes the record down in a book] 19 seconds.
Lou: Okay, so it's a $1.42.
SpongeBob: Sign here please. [Lou signs at the places that SpongeBob points] Initial here, and here, and here, and here. [SpongeBob notices a picture of Lou from a while back] Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here! [picture shows a happy Lou] Look at you, so young and happy! [puts the picture down and we see a sad Lou] Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? "Plan Your Own Party Kit"? Hey Lou, how much?
Lou: For the Plan Your Own Party kit? Oh, we're having a special on those. Uh, they're free. But you have to leave...[scowls] right now.
[scene cuts to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Let's see Gary, according to the "Plan Your Own Party Kit," invitations are the first order of business.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [reads first thing on list] "A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success." Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends.
Fred's dad: [reads invitation] Who the barnacle is SpongeBob SquarePants? [Mable peeks from around the corner]
Mable: I believe you went to kindergarten with him, dear.
Fred's dad: Kindergarten, huh? [Dad shows a picture of SpongeBob and his Kindergarten class] Oh yeah, SquarePants. Well, I guess it's time to move again.
SpongeBob: Boy, Gary, this "Plan Your Own Party Kit" is a real life-saver. [mixing ingredients and reading a cook book] How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream. [takes a little taste] Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world! [timer goes off] My piñata! [takes out the piñata from the oven and he squeals; he tosses it around] Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. [he puts it on the table] The "Plan Your Own Party Kit" suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs. [puts eggs in the piñata]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good question Gary, but not to worry. The "Plan Your Own Party Kit" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule! [takes out list] 8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution. [list rolls across the table] At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades. [list rolls along the wall] 9:38: charity apple-bob. [list is still rolling around] 9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice. [winks at Gary. The list stops on SpongeBob's head] At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success. This is gonna be the coolest party ever! [puts a party hat on Gary's shell. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Ha, ha! Looks like it's smooth party sailing for SpongeBob so far. Now it's time for me to get my own party underway! Gather around, ye scurvy landlubbers, it's time to learn the peg legged dance o' happiness. [lays out a dance mat] Oh, it's quite simple really, all you need is a peg leg and some patience. And my instructional video series, only $29.95.
Potty: Bawk! How tacky. [flies off]
Patchy: It's a $40 value, Potty! [yelling] A $40 value! Now, it's very easy and loads of fun.
Salt Water Sam: Hey, everybody, the band's here.
[party guests cheer off-screen]
Patchy: Band? What band?
Potty: Bawk, the band I hired for the party. [Patchy was laughing]
Patchy: A jolly idea, Potty. A little live musical get me shindig dug. Who'd you get? [a picture of every group is shown as Patchy says their name] Barnacle Bill and the Seven Seas?
Potty: No.
Patchy: Seaweed Sally and her Cackling Turtle?
Potty: No.
Patchy: Oh, oh, I know: The First Mates.
Potty: No.
Patchy: Saltwater Sam, featuring the Brine Brothers.
Potty: No.
Patchy: Uh, Rusty Hinges and the Boys from the Brig?
Potty: They broke up years ago.
Patchy: Well, who else is there?
Potty: The Bird Brains!
Patchy: Oh.. [laughs, but then chuckles in confusion]
Potty: The Bird Brains--They're better than all those other bands.
Patchy: But they're just a bunch of birds.
Lead Singer: Hello, Encino! [The Bird Brains begin playing heavy metal music]
Patchy: Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ohh! [A blast of heavy metal rock music sends a screaming Patchy flying backwards out of the house, blasting him through six more houses before slamming face-first into a metal telephone pole. Back at the party, the band continues to play; Patchy enters his house while covered with debris] No, no, No! Stop the music! [yells as he runs to the band and the music stops] Stop! Look, boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time! I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.
Lead Singer: You mean we're fired?
Patchy: No. [Patchy and the band go to the plank.] Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword! Ha, ha, ha... [laughs, the birds just fly away] No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh! [breaks down sobbing]
Narrator: [screen: PLEASE STAND BY] While Patchy pulls himself together, let's see how SpongeBob's party is shaping up. [shows SpongeBob's house decorated]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come! [looks at his watch] Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00. [gasps] Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed! [cries] No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever! [doorbell rings] Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late. [opens door to see Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?
Patrick: Sure? [SpongeBob runs over and pours a glass]
SpongeBob: Did you have any trouble finding the place? [gives Patrick the glass] Here you are!
Patrick: Thanks. [drinks some punch]
SpongeBob: So, the punch okay?
Patrick: Not bad, not bad.
SpongeBob: Hmm, nice weather we're having.
Patrick: It's been very mild, yes.
SpongeBob: Yep, it's mild season. [nervously laughs] Ahem. So, you read any... [doorbell rings] Oh, more party guests! [Mr. Krabs has walked in with a purple coat on] Welcome, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.
Mr. Krabs: Don't mind if I do! [drops his coat on Gary. Gary sticks his eyes out of the sleeves]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [looks over his party list] Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot... [hands Patrick and Mr. Krabs name tags] These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions. [doorbell rings] Oh, more guests! [Patrick tries to read his name tag upside down]
Patrick: Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.
Mr. Krabs: No, you dumb bunny, it says, "Hello, my name is Patrick."
Patrick: [shakes Mr Krabs' hand] Nice to meet you Patrick.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Good one, Patrick! [both laugh]
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick. [doorbell rings]
Patrick: Was he talking to me or you? [SpongeBob opens door to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you made it!
Squidward: My cable's out.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that. [SpongeBob hides some wire cutters behind his back]
Mr Krabs: So, uh, how's it going, Squidward?
Squidward: Not bad.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob clears his throat, attracting Mr. Krabs and Squidward's attention] I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47. [erases something on his clipboard and clicks his tongue] But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter. [SpongeBob takes Scooter and places him near Squidward] Here are some topic cards to break the ice. [hands them some cards. The doorbell rings] Oh, someone's at the door!
Scooter: Mine says, 'What came first?: the oyster or the pearl?' You take the side of the pearl!
Squidward: This is lame. [Squidward throws away his card and walks away]
Sadie: My card says, "Discuss the philosophical nature of irony." What does yours say?
Patrick: "Nod politely." [shown Mr. Krabs and Plankton with cards]
Mr. Krabs: What does yours say, Plankton?
Plankton: Oh, uh, it says, [really shows "Where are You From?"] 'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.' [clears throat] How interesting.
Mr. Krabs: Nice try, Plankton. [everyone is chattering amongst themselves. The doorbell rings]
SpongeBob: [he is looking angrily at his watch and tapping his foot and the doorbell rings] Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive... [looks at his watch] 22 minutes late! [opens up the door to Tom Smith]
Tom: Hey, hey! [SpongeBob folds his arms in a sort of anger. Tom laughs nervously holding a bag of chips as SpongeBob walks into the party]
SpongeBob: Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position! [silence. everyone claps silently] As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me! [laughs as he walks into a room with a sign that reads 'Coat Check', but ducks back out with a serious look] Seriously. [closes door]
Narrator: (television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages. [fades out and back in] [Patchy is shown dancing and a guy in a submarine outfit walks towards the camera] Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!
SpongeBob: [scene cuts to his wardrobe] Hey, Gare, got another coat for you. [throws the coat on Gary] The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to [uses air quotes] work. [cackles and walks back out with his clipboard] Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here? [guests are talking and dancing to the music. SpongeBob starts to hyperventilate] This is all wrong! What's happening to my party? [scene cuts to Sandy and Larry dancing] No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm! [scene cuts to Sandals eating cake. SpongeBob takes a vacuum and sucks out all the food from his mouth] Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52! [switches into 'blower.' Slice of cake is blown perfectly back into the rest of the cake. A plate with bacon and eggs is blown onto the table] Hey, what's this?
Sandals: That's my breakfast!
SpongeBob: Could I have everyone's attention please? [Patrick is dancing by the record player] Patrick! [stops the music] If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks. [the guests walk over to the couch] Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means! [gets out a newspaper] Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this! [guests cheer] This is yesterday's paper. [they stop cheering as SpongeBob walks outside] I'll just go grab today's paper. [everyone starts to party when he leaves. talking to himself] SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you? [tries to open the door] Locked out? [knocks on the door. Scene cuts to Patrick and Sandy are dancing]
Sandy: This song's got a great beat.
Patrick: Yeah. Knock, knock.
SpongeBob: Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me? [looks through the window and his eyes bug out as he wails. He sees the party, with all the guests dancing and having fun and the music blasting] Oh no! [cut to the topic cards on the floor and two fish just talking] They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing! [cut to Patrick eating all the deviled eggs in the piñata in one gulp and everyone else cheering him on] Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs! [scene cuts to two guests laughing] Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it. [scene cuts to Patrick and Mrs. Puff talking]
Patrick: So, do you come here often?
Mrs. Puff: No. [phone rings. Patrick answers]
Patrick: Hello, SquarePants residence. What? [covers one ear] I'm sorry, what? [scene cuts to SpongeBob using a pay phone outside, across the street]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!
Patrick: You wanna talk to SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!
Patrick: Okay, hold on. [opens door] SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!
SpongeBob: What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait! [SpongeBob runs toward the door.]
Patrick: Sorry, he's not out there. [Patrick closes it in front of him before he gets inside]
Scooter: Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.
Patrick: Thanks. [Patrick hands the phone to an ice sculpture of SpongeBob's head] Here you go, SpongeBob. [drops the phone in the punch]
SpongeBob: Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule! [looks up noticing the bathroom window is open. Scene cuts to Larry looking in the window]
Larry: Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat! [the mirror shows a real lobster on a plate] Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind. [looks through the medicine cabinet. He finds a comb with three angles and teeth coming out from them] Hey, check out his crazy comb.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet. [climbs up the side of his house] I hope they don't touch my special comb.
Larry: Well, I think I've aired it up enough. [Larry closes the window on SpongeBob's fingers. SpongeBob falls down screaming. Larry hears the screams] Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands flat on the ground then gets up and looks at his broken fingers] I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events! [scene cuts to inside where Pearl and Mrs Puff talking to each other]
Pearl: Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes, everything is quite lovely. [sees SpongeBob spying through the window] Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings. [turns the window around]
SpongeBob: I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in! [takes a shovel and digs. Digs up into the middle of the party] Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned. [guests are hopping around the room. They hop on SpongeBob and send him through the hole he dug] I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but... [now wearing a bunny suit] ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in! [takes a pick-ax to cut the door but a bright light shines at him]
Officer John: Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?
Officer O'Malley: I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.
Officer John: You criminals make me sick.
SpongeBob: I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!
Officer John: [smiles] Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!
Officer O'Malley: You have a nice party now, sir. [both walk off]
SpongeBob: Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.
Officer John: Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?
SpongeBob: [stammer-like] But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.
Officer O'Malley: Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge. [handcuffs SpongeBob but the handcuffs are not working] Oh no, these cuffs are broken.
Officer John: Huh, we can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.
[bubble transition to Officers John and O'Malley taking SpongeBob to jail in a pillory]
SpongeBob: Is it too late to offer you some punch?
Officer O'Malley: Sir, you have the right to remain silent. [scene cuts to next day]
SpongeBob: All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit! [tries to open the door] Oh, yeah, the door's locked. [lifts up the welcome mat] Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr! [inserts key and walks in] Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster. [Patrick walks up]
Patrick: That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!
SpongeBob: It was?
Patrick: Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!
SpongeBob: I am?
Patrick: Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya! [walks out]
SpongeBob: [smiles] SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all. [Gary's got a lampshade on his head] Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [turns off the light and Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going! Ready for some real music, Potty?
Potty: [someone places corks in his ears] Bawk! Okay, ready.
Patchy: [starts singing and, while he singing, everybody is simply staring at him] ♪Oh... scurvy ain't for the likes of me, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho... Oh! Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho.. Oh, scurvy ain't for the likes of..♪
Potty: Bawk! It's time for your flute solo.
Patchy: Thank you, Potty, I almost forgot... [Potty gives him the flute and he is about to play it, but Patchy stops] Hey wait a minute. I don't play a flute. I play a fife. [Patchy turns and sees that the "flute" is actually a lit stick of dynamite; He screams in horror] Potty, no! [the dynamite explodes and everybody cheers] Wow, I can't believe I survived that one. [realizes his body is destroyed and he is reduced to only a head; he whimpers] Potty, help me!
Potty: Ladies and Gentlemen, bawk! The Bird Brains!
Bird Brains: ♪Come with me to the land I love, It's not right here, down the street, or up above. It's down below in the deep blue sea. Where SpongeBob lives, and the fun is always free. Down, down, down, to the bottom of the sea. Where our salty friend SpongeBob waits for you and me. [dolphin chirps] Down, down, down, ahh, we'll have lots of fun. You and me forever in the underwater sun. We'll catch some jellyfish if we get a chance, Say hello to Patrick, and do a little dance, Karate chop Sandy, see Squid get a tan, Eat a Krabby Patty and foil Plankton's plan. Down, down, down, to the bottom of the sea. We'll hook up with SpongeBob and his snail Gary. [Gary meows] Down, down, down, ahh, we'll have lots of fun You and me forever in the underwater sun, underwater sun.♪ [everybody cheers]
Patchy: [has a barrel on wheels for a new body and two wooden poles sticking out of it for arms] Aha! Great job, boys! Thanks for stopping by! Don't hit the porthole on the way out. [to the audience] And thank you for stopping by! You've made this party a real fun time. [The doorbell rings]
Potty: Bawk, the ladies are here!
Patchy: Oh! Ladies! Shiver me timbers! Welcome, girlies! [chuckles, but stops because the ladies are female birds and they giggle as they come in and attack him] Huh! No!
Potty: Goodbye, folks!
Patchy: It's Potty you're after!
Narrator: Thank you for coming to SpongeBob's House Party!
Patchy: Belay the smooching. Belay the smooching!
Narrator: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [we see a long line to the Krusty Krab] In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration.
Frank: Will you hurry up?
Narrator: A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions. If they weren't the ones causing the problem.
Mermaid Man: Let's see... I want a... no. [Shows a brief shot of Krusty Krab Menu] I want a... [camera returns to Mermaid Man] uh, no, uh, hmmm...
Squidward: Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!
SpongeBob: [whispering in Mermaid Man's ear] Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
Mermaid Man: I've made my decision!
Line of Customers: Hooray!
Mermaid Man: One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.
Barnacle Boy: Now, wait just a darn minute!
Line of Customers: Awww!
Barnacle Boy: I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty! I want an adult size Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.
Barnacle Boy: Don't you see what you're doing? You're treating me like a child!
Mr. Krabs: The boy’s eyes are bigger than his stomach. [laughs]
Barnacle Boy: And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles in my liver spots. [shows a hair popping out]
Squidward: [snickering] One Pipsqueak patty [close up of the patty] and your bib and highchair.
Barnacle Boy: I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?
Barnacle Boy: Feed this, old man! [slaps the Krabby Patty out of Mermaid Man's hand]
All except MM and BB:  Ooooooooh.
Barnacle Boy: I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through protecting citizens that don't respect me!
SpongeBob: I respect you, Barnacle Man!
SpongeBob: [turns off the alarm] Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary. [Gary pushes a button that sends SpongeBob jumping out of his bed, into the air. SpongeBob bounces off a chair, while sipping his cup of tea] Ahh... [toast pop out into the air, where SpongeBob eats them. Gary spits SpongeBob's pants into the air where SpongeBob lands on a target that Gary has painted] Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though. [Gary gives him an angry look. SpongeBob heads to the door] See you later. [opens the door where Patrick is standing there with a net in his hand]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.
Patrick: Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?
SpongeBob: I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?
Patrick: [starts to cry] Wait for you to get back.
SpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?
Patrick: Hey, that's a great idea!
SpongeBob: You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it! [Patrick imagines a Kindergarten Class photo of him and SpongeBob smiling goofy with each other]
Patrick: Wow. [scene cuts to them at school]
SpongeBob: Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime. [shows Patrick Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Patrick: [laughs] And no line.
SpongeBob: Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning. [runs up to the water fountain] And this is the Fountain Of Learning. [runs to the lockers] And these are the Lockers Of Learning.
Patrick: [runs up to some stairs] And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?
SpongeBob: No, they're just the stairs. [walks over to another set of stairs] These are the Stairs Of Learning.
Patrick: Where is everyone?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00.
Patrick: [He suddenly, hilariously wears a watch, and looks at it] 6:20? But I thought you said you were late.
SpongeBob: Late for being early.
Patrick: Hey! [looks at his watch] When did I start wearing a watch?
SpongeBob: [both walk into the classroom] And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.
Patrick: Ohh.
SpongeBob: [walks up to the chalkboard] And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.
Patrick: Ohhh.
SpongeBob: [walks up to the Good Noodle Board] And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.[looks at Patrick]
Patrick: Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!
SpongeBob: [points to each star] Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too. [adds Patrick's name] There you are.
Patrick: But look at all the stars you have. I'll never be that good.
SpongeBob: Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem! [high pitched] 74.
Patrick: Who said that? [runs over to an egg in a box] Was it him?
SpongeBob: I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.
Patrick: What does he teach us?
SpongeBob: The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat. [points the light bulb] This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die.
Patrick: [turns light on and off] Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: [turns light on] Sorry. [SpongeBob moves his desk to the front of the teacher's desk]
SpongeBob: The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?
Patrick: [jumps into the chair] I'm learning!
SpongeBob: This is gonna be great! [both giggle. Scene cuts to class]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?
Patrick: [confused] Who's the fat kid talking to?
SpongeBob: You, Patrick, she's the teacher.
Patrick: Oh.
Mrs. Puff: Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous. [Patrick gets up and looks at class]
Patrick: Uh...uh...
Mrs. Puff: We just want to know your name. [Patrick gets more nervous]
Patrick: Uh...uh...uh!...24! [class laughs hysterically]
Mrs. Puff: [sarcastically] Oh, great, another genius...
Patrick: [sits back down] Why are they laughing?
SpongeBob: I guess it's just in the timing.
Patrick: Oh. [Patrick laughs after a brief pause]
Mrs. Puff: [writes on the chalkboard] Today's first lesson will be on turning.
Patrick: 24. [both start to giggle, and Mrs. Puff pauses and continues writing]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I thought of something funnier than 24.
Patrick: Let me hear it.
SpongeBob: [stifled laugh] 25. [both try and fail to hold in their laughter. Patrick goes red in the face while SpongeBob bangs his fist on his desk]
Mrs. Puff: [overhears] That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Now then, "Turning"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least... [Patrick places a paper on SpongeBob's desk]
SpongeBob: [looks at the drawing Patrick gave him of Mrs. Puff and gasps] Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!
Mrs. Puff: What about the teacher? [SpongeBob screams then shivers and bites his lip in fear as Mrs. Puff sees Patrick's drawing of her. She now appears the same shape as Patrick's drawing to demonstrate the "ugly" drawing.] As if I really look like this! [puts it a drawer with a bunch of other bad drawings of her. Mrs. Puff returns back to her original shape and blames SpongeBob.] SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions. [Takes out a scraper. Scraper shines.]
SpongeBob: No...
Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle. [walks over to the Good Noodle Board]
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!
Mrs. Puff: [about to remove the star] You'll get this star back when you earn it.
SpongeBob: [wailing] No! [As Mrs. Puff positions the scraper under the star and begins to peel it off, SpongeBob goes berserk, bouncing up and down in his seat and banging his head on his desk, constantly panting as he bangs his head.] [SpongeBob's head spins around on his body as Mrs. Puff slowly removes the star.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  [When the glue holding the star to the board stretches to the point of it snapping off the board, SpongeBob's eyes roll to the back of his head and he faints, sliding out of his seat onto the floor.]
Patrick: [raises his hand] Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!
SpongeBob: What, me? But why?
Mrs. Puff: Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!
SpongeBob: [Mad] Thanks a lot, Patrick.
Patrick: Sure thing, buddy. [SpongeBob walks to the back. His classmates are staring at him]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here. [Mrs. Puff's voice is receding as SpongeBob tries to listen from the back] It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway? [reads the writing on the desk] 'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?
Patrick: Psst, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [to himself] Just ignore him, SpongeBob.
Patrick: SpongeBob, over here.
SpongeBob: Whatever you do, don't look at him.
Patrick: Psst, SpongeBob. [grunts as he throws a piece of wadded-up paper at SpongeBob] Psst, SpongeBob. [throws a book at SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [spits a bunch of spitballs on SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.
SpongeBob: [whispers loudly] What?
Patrick: [meekly] Hi.
SpongeBob: [yells] HI?! [he growls, removing all the spitballs, then stops when he sees Mrs. Puff angry, covered in spitballs]
Mrs. Puff: Perhaps this would be a good time for recess. [scene cuts to SpongeBob at his locker. Patrick walks up to him]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff.
SpongeBob: [angrily slams his locker] There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!
Patrick: [becomes angry] Who cares about a stupid star?
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!
Patrick: I'll deal with you after class!
SpongeBob: It is after class! [a group of students crowd around SpongeBob and Patrick chanting 'fight']
Patrick: I don't see anyone fighting, do you?
SpongeBob: They're talking about us! We're fighting!
Patrick: Well, don't mind if I do! [both start to punch. The group of students start to quiet down as they notice SpongeBob and Patrick are punching, but missing at the same time]
Student: This is embarrassing. [everyone leaves as Mrs. Puff walks up]
Mrs. Puff: [lifts SpongeBob and Patrick] What's going on here?! [looks at Patrick] Well?
Patrick: SpongeBob and I were fighting.
Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Fighting? [puts them down] Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend [lights dim on Mrs. Puff and scary music plays] to detention!
SpongeBob: Detention!?
Mrs. Puff: May Neptune have mercy on your souls. [Mrs. Puff turns off the flashlight she was holding. Scene cuts to classroom where SpongeBob is sitting at the front and Patrick is sitting at the back]
SpongeBob: [sulking] In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg. [angrily] It's all Stupid Patrick's fault. [turns to look at Patrick] I hate you, Patrick.
Patrick: I hate you more.
SpongeBob: I'd hate you no matter what.
Patrick: Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.
SpongeBob: [stares at Patrick for a few seconds, then narrows his eyes] I'd hate you even if that made sense.
Patrick: I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.
SpongeBob: I'd hate you, even if, uhh... [tries to think of something else to say] Um, I'd hate you... [points to Roger's tank] even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out. [The camera quickly pans over to where SpongeBob is pointing. Suddenly, the light bulb flickers, and then burns out completely, with smoke rising out of the light bulb] Huh?
[SpongeBob bites his lip and starts shivering. He glances over at Patrick. Patrick is sitting at his desk about to cry.]
Patrick: Ohh... [He starts to turn to look at SpongeBob, but when he sees him, he quickly looks away from him, crossing his arms.] Hmph.
[SpongeBob watches Patrick, surprised, then does the same. But then he sees Roger's egg shivering in his tank and really starts to panic. We then see that it's snowing in Roger's tank. Snow is piled up around Roger, who is shivering under a pile of snow. Sleigh bells jingle in the background.]
Patrick: [teary-eyed again] Ohhhhh...! [cut back to Roger, who is frozen inside a giant ice cube, with wind blowing]
[SpongeBob and Patrick begin to quietly sob. The camera closes-up on SpongeBob, then Patrick. Finally, unable to take it anymore, SpongeBob turns around in his desk.]
SpongeBob: Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!
Patrick: [talking fast] I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs...
SpongeBob: I'm sorry your apology is so long!
Patrick: Me too! Let's save Roger! [they run to Roger]
SpongeBob: [takes Roger] I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet.
Patrick: [opens the door to the supply closet] Ahh. Light bulb! [there is a pile of light bulbs, but Patrick is looking at the one that is already plugged in at the top] But why does it have to be so far away? [begins to climb the pile of bulbs. SpongeBob tries warming up the egg by sitting on it, huffing and puffing on it, etc. while Patrick is still climbing the pile of light bulbs, wearing fancy clothing. Patrick finally reaches the top, blows a horn, removes his clothes, then runs down the pile with the light bulb] I'm coming, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth. [runs into Patrick and both of their items are in the air] The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!
Patrick: Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm! [both jump for the item that is closest to them and crash into the floor with an item in their hands. They put the light bulb and egg back where they were]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!
Mrs. Puff: [off-screen] Good job boys! [Mrs. Puff turns on a light from behind the chalkboard] I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.
Patrick: Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big, Fat Meanie. [leaves the classroom]
Roger: [egg hatches] Hey what'd I miss?
Sandals: Uhh, what do you like better? The coral bits or the nacho oyster skins?
Squidward: I like neither. Can I take your order?
Sandals: What about the barnacle rings, are they any good?
Squidward: No. What will you have?
Sandals: Well, uhh, what's your vote on the kelp?
Squidward: [He finally loses his temper and he throws the paper and pencil in anger] Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?
SpongeBob: [Pokes his head out from behind the kitchen window] Psst, try the coral bits.
Sandals: Uhh, I'll try the coral bits.
Squidward: That'll be one dollar. [Rings up one dollar then a siren goes off]
Sandals: What's going on?
Squidward: Something stupid, I'm sure. [Alarm stops as a curtain opens up to show a real band in the background playing carnival music. Mr. Krabs comes out from the restroom, cheering]
Mr. Krabs: Yippee! [Kisses Sandals and Squidward. Takes the dollar and laughs hysterically as he rubs it all over himself] Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!
Squidward: See? I told you.
SpongeBob: What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [Looks weird as he runs over to the counter] Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!
Squidward: A very dirty dollar?
Mr. Krabs: No! This is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, Sir. You have just given me my one millionth dollar.
Sandals: Ha, great. Uhh, what do I win?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing. Now get out.
Sandals: Uhh, what?
Mr. Krabs: Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment! [Pushes everyone out the door] Me millionth dollar.
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Congratulate yourselves, lad. A captain's nothing without his loyal crew. I mean, a crew like you [He imagines SpongeBob and Squidward looking deformed] comes around maybe once in a lifetime. And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.
SpongeBob: Wow, a trip!
Squidward: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where we going, Fancy Springs?
[Scene cuts to the three of them in a pool]
Mr. Krabs: No.
Squidward: Pamper Island?
[Scene cuts to the three of them laying on towels at a beach]
Mr. Krabs: Try again.
Squidward: Ooh, ooh, ooh, Bikini Bottom Folk Village?
[Scene cuts to the three of them in 18th century clothing]
Mr. Krabs: Better than that!
[Scene cuts to them wearing raincoats on a boat accompanied by a foghorn noise]
Squidward: Clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work? [Clams are jumping] Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?
Mr. Krabs: Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams [Catches a clam then he throws it back] then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?
Squidward: No. [Takes off his raincoat and sits on his chair] And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?
Squidward: How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?
SpongeBob: Okay. [SpongeBob casts his line behind him which catches on Squidward's magazine. SpongeBob brings his line forward and casts it in the lagoon. SpongeBob casts Squidward's chair]
Squidward: Hey, watch where you're swinging that... [SpongeBob casts Squidward's shirt out in the lagoon] SpongeBob, be careful with... ow! [SpongeBob casts Squidward's nose into the lagoon. Squidward screams loudly in pain, then walks up to Mr. Krabs] Okay, I've had enough.
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up. [SpongeBob is still casting out items while Mr. Krabs talks to Squidward] Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose. [Laughs. The hook in SpongeBob's fishing rod touches Mr. Krabs millionth dollar. Gasps] Me millionth dollar! [SpongeBob rips Mr. Krabs' pants off and casts his dollar to the lagoon] SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya. [Music plays] Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in. Can't you hear the music? That's a 44 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster! [SpongeBob reels it in as fast as he can. Mr. Krabs opens the doors to the orchestra] There you are, ya stinkin' bilge rats! [to the trumpeters] Stop playing that music! [to the conductor] Stop it, please! [to the violinists] I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it! Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Here she comes...She made it!
Mr. Krabs: [Holds up the dollar and cheers] For a second or two, I thought she was a goner. [Ominous orchestra music plays again. Suddenly, a giant clam jumps up and takes Mr. Krabs' dollar. It takes a while for Mr. Krabs to notice his dollar isn't in his claw anymore. The clam swims away. The scene cuts as Mr. Krabs’ eyes well up with tears, and he begins to cry]
Squidward: So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward! You're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar! [sobbing and flops to the ground] I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back! [Whips his eyes against the floor] Never, never, never, never, never!
SpongeBob: I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up. [Mr. Krabs is literally in pieces, crying]
Squidward: Oh, puh-lease, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act. [Mr. Krabs is crying while sucking his feet] Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar. [Mr. Krabs continues weeping as he pours tears into his mouth] For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up! [Mr. Krabs' eyes inflate then squirt out tears] Mr. Krabs... [Mr. Krabs is wailing like a fountain] Mr. Krabs... [Mr. Krabs is sobbing like a faucet. Squidward has had enough.] Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!
Mr. Krabs: [Sucks on a thumb then he throws it away] You will? Great! Wait right here. [Runs off to get some items and comes back with a bunch of fishing gear on] Here's where clam fishing gets serious. [Scene cuts to later in the day where Mr. Krabs is on top of the boat and SpongeBob and Squidward are on the lower deck] Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.
SpongeBob: [Salutes] Aye aye, captain!
Mr. Krabs: And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar. [Mr. Krabs scouts the area. Scene cuts to later where Mr. Krabs has a beard on from scouting for too long. Squidward and SpongeBob look the same as Mr. Krabs]
Squidward: [Ripping off his beard] That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!
SpongeBob: Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary. [Scene cuts to Gary chewing up SpongeBob's couch at home]
Squidward: We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar! [Takes a dollar out of his wallet] Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?
SpongeBob: Oh, I get ya. [Jabbers. Scene cuts to later in the day where Mr. Krabs is still scouting the area]
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs steers his eyes toward the other two to see them waving a dollar] Look what we've got!
Mr. Krabs: [Jumps down and gasps] Could it be? [Takes the dollar] Me millionth dollar? [Starts cheering again as well as SpongeBob and Squidward] Whoo-hoo! [Rubs the dollar on himself but he notices something strange so he stops dancing] Wait a minute... [Rubs the dollar back and forth again and points at the dollar] This isn't me millionth dollar. [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other] This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, [Shows dollar bill just like described] and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.
SpongeBob: [wearing blue lipstick] Actually, it's Coral Blue number- [Squidward whacks him on the head with a fishing rod to shut him up, but it's already too late] three!
Mr. Krabs: I trusted you, and you gave me this?! I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this. [sobs]
Squidward: No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.
Mr. Krabs: [stops sobbing, then narrows his eyes] I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.
Squidward: You're kidding?
SpongeBob: Woo! Is it another fishing trip?
Mr. Krabs: No. It's this sandwich. [Nails the sandwich to a pole]
Squidward: A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?
Mr. Krabs: Not a sandwich. [throws the other sandwiches into the lagoon] The sandwich.
Squidward: Whatever. We've got plenty more to... [He and SpongeBob get shocked. Mr. Krabs throws the refrigerator into the lagoon] ...eat.
Mr. Krabs: Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back.
Squidward: Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone completely insane?!
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: Just look at him. [Pointing to Mr. Krabs, who is dressed like he is at a funeral sobbing at a tombstone with the words 'R.I.P. Me Millionth Dollar' on it. He then hugs it.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you&#8212;
Squidward: Look again. [Mr. Krabs uses his eyes as a jump rope while giggling like a crazy person]
SpongeBob: [now visibly scared] You're right. How do we get outta here?
Squidward: If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.
SpongeBob: Okay. [Both take a step, then start screaming as they sprint over to the lifeboat. They jump into it but then come back onto the boat tied up; Mr. Krabs pops his head out of the lifeboat]
Mr. Krabs: So you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. "It's just a dumb old dollar. Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice." [sobs] Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you: [Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs hanging his line over the boat. SpongeBob and Squidward are attached to the line] live bait!
Squidward: You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?
Mr. Krabs: [Dressed up as a conductor] Oh, he'll come. [Taps the book using his baton and the doors open up to the orchestra and begins to play the ominous music; SpongeBob and Squidward shake and scream in terror]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say... [Yells] you are completely out of your mind! [Mr. Krabs giggles madly while conducting the orchestra. The giant clam emerges above the lagoon coming closer to the two on the line] Get us out of here!
Mr. Krabs: Come on, fresh meat! [SpongeBob and Squidward scream as they try to wiggle back and forth to avoid the giant clam] Keep thrashing! He likes it! [Both continue to scream and bounce up and down really fast] Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there. [Giant clam shows the dollar on its tongue] That's it! [Closes the doors to cause the music to stop. The giant clam stops in mid-air and Mr. Krabs jumps inside it to take the dollar] Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it! [Rubs his dollar on himself] I finally got me millionth dollar! [Cabin doors open to play the ominous music again. The giant clam closes its mouth, with Mr. Krabs inside, and dives into the lagoon. Cabin doors close as the conductor takes a bow to the applauding audience]
SpongeBob: Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives... [A tear falls down his cheek] Why couldn't it have been me?!
Squidward: Yes, why couldn't it have been you?! [Sobbing]
SpongeBob: Why did he have to go like this?! Why? [Crying]
Squidward: Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?! [Both sob]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, boys. [SpongeBob and Squidward stop sobbing]
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs' head is above the lagoon]
Mr. Krabs: Have you boys met... [Holds his millionth dollar up] ...me millionth dollar? [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow, how did you get it back?
Mr. Krabs: It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter. So, eventually, we settled on a trade.
SpongeBob: What did you give him? [Mr. Krabs jumps back up on the boat, revealing himself as only having a head and left arm]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing important. [Laughs. SpongeBob and Squidward look shocked.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, pineapple! [plays the bugle to wake Gary up] Good morning, Gary! [pats Gary's shell]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [opens his front door] Good morning, world! I'm ready! World? [scene pans over to Squidward's front door, where a delivery man with a pet cage walks over and knocks on his door]
Squidward: Talk to me.
Delivery Man: [waves hat] Package, sir.
Squidward: A-ha! [Squidward signs a clipboard] I can't believe it's finally here! [delivery man hands him the cage]
Delivery Man: Here ya go!
Squidward: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. [hands him the clipboard]
Delivery Man: Thank you, Mr... mmm... "Tennisballs."
Squidward: [winces, then scowls] That's Tentacles! [takes pet cage and slams the door shut]
SpongeBob: Squidward's last name is Tentacles?
Patrick: Poor guy. [Squidward walks out with a new snail with a bow on her shell] Hey, check out Squidward's new snail.
SpongeBob: [whistles as Squidward frowns] Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.
Squidward: Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob. [holding his snail smugly] I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.
Patrick: Wow, a snail made out of bread.
Squidward: No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See? [holds up a certificate] She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.
SpongeBob: Training?
Squidward: For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.
Patrick: Sunday?
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!
Squidward: No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt. [Gary is shown looking like a hillbilly with a chimney in his shell]
SpongeBob: Boy, you got that right. Gary's no... [scowls] hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race? [Squidward shows the certificate again]
Squidward: Papers. [Patrick walks up and reads it]
Patrick: Hmmm. 'Property of Squidward... Tentpoles.'
Squidward: That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie. [walks off]
SpongeBob: You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Patrick: Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward! [Patrick runs off]
SpongeBob: Are you thinking what I'm thinking? [Gary imagines himself watching TV] No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail! [SpongeBob runs off. He then returns, wearing a coach's outfit] Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies! [laughs] I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use. [scene cuts to Sandy walking down the street]
Sandy: Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow. [scene cuts to SpongeBob opening a can]
SpongeBob: Kelp powder for muscle mass. [drops the food in a blender as Gary looks on with disgust] Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché. [drops the eggs in the blender] And nails for toughness. [drops the nails in the blender. Turns on the blender]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Of course, I expect you to eat this. [Gary's eyes widen. SpongeBob pours some of the blended food into a glass] It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary? [Gary is already out of the room through his snail door. SpongeBob stops his stopwatch] Wow, pretty good time.
Patrick: [holding a rock] Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.
SpongeBob: Patrick, your snail is a rock.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Boy, the competition's getting tough. [walks over to Gary watching TV] That's it, Gary. [takes out a leash] We are going to start some serious training right now.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [puts the leash on Gary. Gary tries to stretch his eyes to watching the TV as long as he can before he's pulled out of the room] Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints. [holds up a stopwatch] On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary! [SpongeBob notices Gary is not there] Gary? [SpongeBob walks up to Gary, who is watching more TV] Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.
Squidward: [pops his head in SpongeBob's lower window] Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.
Patrick: [pops his head in SpongeBob's upper window] Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail. [shows his rock]
Squidward: Patrick, that's a rock.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.
Squidward: What are you standing on, anyway? [scene shows Patrick is standing on Squidward's back] Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow. [Squidward walks off as Patrick falls to the ground. Patrick pops his head in the lower window]
Patrick: My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do. [picks up Gary and walks off]
Patrick: You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Gary outside]
SpongeBob: Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious. [scene cuts to SpongeBob blowing on a whistle] Come on, Gary, move it! [scene cuts to Gary crawling up and down a wall] Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down! [scene cuts to Gary punching a punching bag with his eyes] Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go! [scene cuts to SpongeBob following Gary on his bike] Come on, push it, Gary, push it! [scene cuts to Gary on the toilet] Move that shell! [scene cuts to Gary in the bathtub with SpongeBob looking through the curtains] Come on, Gary, move it! [scene cuts to Gary eating] Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster! [scene cuts to nighttime. Gary is on an exercise wheel while SpongeBob is sleeping but giving orders at the same time] Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it... [scene cuts to morning, where Gary is tired, out of breath, and on a leash] Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke. [Gary is pulling SpongeBob in a wagon] Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race! [scene cuts to an announcer]
Nat: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our live coverage of this year's annual spring classic, the 102nd Running of the Snail. And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.
Perch Perkins: Hey, what are you doing?! [Nat runs away as the announcer comes and sits down] Heh, sorry about that, folks. Let's go down to the field to join the mayor for the pre-game ceremony. [scene cuts to a large fish standing by a microphone]
Mayor: And now, for the lighting of the Torch of Good Sportsmanship, please join me in welcoming snail racing's first-ever champion, Lightning Larry Luciano! [crowd cheers as the band plays. Larry comes crawling out every so slowly with a flame attached on his back]
Perch Perkins: Would you look at that, folks? Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage. And what a proud moment for this sport. The crowd is going absolutely nuts... [crowd is cheering] ...for Larry. [Larry is still crawling to the torch] He's almost there. Uhh, yes, any minute now.
Narrator: Two hours later... [band is not playing as loud]
Perch Perkins: He's almost a quarter of the way there. [As Larry is still crawling up to the torch, one of the band members faints after playing for 2 hours. The mayor checks his watch, then runs over, grabs Larry and lights the torch]
Mayor: The torch is lit! Let the race begin. [the crowd cheers. Cut to the playing field, where SpongeBob and Squidward are standing at the starting line. The snails have markers: Snellie is #6, a very worn out Gary is #7, and Rocky is #8]
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life. [Gary is coughing]
Squidward: I'll alert the paramedics.
Patrick: [laughs] Good one, Squidward.
Official: [walks up to the contestants] You guys ready?
Patrick: [screams] A burglar!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's the official.
Official: We're ready to start here, folks.
Squidward: Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.
Snellie: Meow.
SpongeBob: Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.
Gary: Meow.
Patrick: This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here. [official raises the flag]
Official: On your mark. Get set. [lowers the flag] Slither! [Snellie runs out first]
Perch Perkins: And they're off! Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!
SpongeBob: What! [runs over to Gary]
Squidward: Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!
SpongeBob: What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!
Patrick: It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.
SpongeBob: Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now! [gross close-up on Gary] Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary! [SpongeBob jumps up and down while Gary is moving slowly] Go, go, go, go, go!
Perch Perkins: And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate. Oh, hang on, folks. He doesn't look so good.
SpongeBob: Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster! [Gary tries to go faster]
Perch Perkins: I do not like the look of this.
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?! [Gary eyes are now really small]
Perch Perkins: That coach is pushing that snail too hard!
SpongeBob: Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster! [Gary's left eye explodes] Huh? [crowd gasps]
Perch Perkins: Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout! [Gary's other eye explodes] Oops, make that two, folks.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Gary? [Gary's shell breaks, showing a machine inside]
Perch Perkins: Plus, a blown head gasket! Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it.
SpongeBob: [getting worried] Umm, Gary, you can stop now! [Gary is leaving skid marks on the track]
Perch Perkins: He's losing control! [Gary is running into the walls, making a bunch of sparks]
SpongeBob: You can take a break now if you want to, Gary. [Gary is spinning on the track]
Perch Perkins: He's spinning out of control! [crowd gasps] He's heading straight for the wall! [Gary runs into a wall of tires and explodes. The crowd gasps again, then they cheer]
SpongeBob: No! [two firemen come up and extinguish the smoke. Squidward laughs] Hold on, Gary, I'm coming! [runs onto the track]
Perch Perkins: Whoa. One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track. That is an automatic disqualification. Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen. [Snellie is coming up on the finish line]
Squidward: Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!
SpongeBob: [runs up to Gary, crying] Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You did? [cries more] Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You did? [cries some more] Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!
Snellie: Meow. [Snellie turns around and heads straight to Gary to help him]
Squidward: What?! [Gary notices Snellie racing towards him and he is back to normal now]
SpongeBob: Gary? [Gary and Snellie start purring at each other] Oh!
Crowd: Aww!
Perch Perkins: [laughs] My, oh, my. Folks, I have never seen anything quite like this. It seems Snellie, the leader, just went back to comfort Gary. [Squidward walks up to where the snails are at]
SpongeBob: Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?
Squidward: But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then... [Rocky is at the finish line]
Announcer: And the winner is Rocky! [Patrick cries, the crowd goes wild and Gary and Snellie crawl away]
Squidward: I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock. [Patrick walks over with the trophy he won]
Patrick: Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.
Squidward: Gosh, Patrick, thanks. [reads the engraving] The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward... [we see the engraving and the camera zooms in on Squidward's misspelled last name] ...Tortellini?! Will I ever win? [he, SpongeBob, and Patrick laugh. Sandy comes on-screen and kicks SpongeBob in the air. He and Patrick stop laughing]
Sandy: [angrily] That's for yesterday, SquarePants!
Squidward: [Evening at the Krusty Krab. He switches the 'open' sign to 'closed.' Appears very optimistic.] Closing time. The happiest time of the day! [scene cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen crying and sniffling]
SpongeBob: Closing time. [sniffles] The saddest time of the day! [falls on the ground still crying] Huh? [he notices an old Patty under the grill] It's a Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob tries to pick it up but it's stuck to some gum] Eww... It's cold and hard. [takes the Patty out from under the grill] This could have rolled under there years ago. [pats it on the head] There, there, little one, your journey is almost over. [SpongeBob tosses the Patty in the trash. A siren goes off as a fishing line retrieves the patty]
Mr. Krabs: [runs in] What happened? [gasps then runs up to the trash can] Someone tried to throw away a patty! [takes it off the hook]
Pinch-o-matic: Pinch-o-matic has saved you 5.2 cents.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.
Mr. Krabs: And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun. [hands it to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
Mr. Krabs: You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?
Narrator: The next day...
SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward. [puts the tray with the old Patty on the window]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Hooray. [smells the Patty then flips the top bun off. Flies buzz around the stinking patty.] Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.
Squidward: Whatever. [he hands the tray to Gus] Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty. [Gus sniffs it. He screams with disgust and quickly back-flips his way out of the restaurant. Scene cuts to the Krusty crew standing by the door]
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?
Squidward: What? [splutters in frustration at Krabs' stupidity] Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.
Mr. Krabs: Gone bad? That's nonsense! Bring it here, SpongeBob. [picks up the cage with the Patty inside it] Uh, why is it in a cage?
SpongeBob: Because it growled at me. [Patty is now sentient and starts to growl and bark like some sort of dog. Squidward hides behind Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are. [takes the Patty out of its cage but it still barks and growls in Mr. Krabs' face] No... no... [the Patty barks and growls some more] Stay... [throws a 'treat' into its mouth] Thatta girl! There, there. [He pats it gently] See? Good enough to eat. [about to eat it when an ambulance goes by] Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then... [Takes a bite. Scene cuts to him moaning, now green in color due to food poisoning, being rolled on a hospital bed] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet! [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs in a hospital bed]
Purple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. Krabs, you gave us quite the scare.
Mr. Krabs: So I'm gonna be okay, doc?
Purple Doctorfish: Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart. [looks at the chart] Let's see here. Hmmm... oh, no! [starts to shake] Oh no, this is terrible! [drops the clipboard]
Mr. Krabs: Everything okay, doc?
Purple Doctorfish: Don't touch me! [runs out screaming]
Mr. Krabs: That's not a good sign. [thunder roars as the room turns into green. The Flying Dutchman appears. Mr. Krabs pulls his covers over his head, showing he's scared.]
Flying Dutchman: Har, har har har har har har har har har!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!
Flying Dutchman: Eugene Krabs, your time has come.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh... [looks at the flower vase next to him] Flower!
Flying Dutchman: Oh, sorry. I must have the wrong room. [flies out] Excuse me, nurse?
Nurse: [in a happy, musical tone] Yes?
Flying Dutchman: I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.
Nurse: Oh, he's in that room right there.
Flying Dutchman: No, that's Harold Flower's room.
Nurse: [confused] Harold Flower? [Flying Dutchman goes back to Mr. Krabs in anger]
Flying Dutchman: So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?
Mr. Krabs: What do you want from me?
Flying Dutchman: I'm here to escort you to the resting place of all bad undersea folk: Davy Jones' locker!
Mr. Krabs: Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!
Flying Dutchman: Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker! [Evil laughs. Scene cuts to Davey Jones' locker where Flying Dutchman and Mr. Krabs reappear] Here we are.
Mr. Krabs: [smells something nasty] Blec! Why does it smell so foul?
Flying Dutchman: Davy Jones works out a lot. [opens the locker where a bunch of smelly gym socks are] These are his socks. Get in!
Mr. Krabs: [gets on his knees and starts crying] Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!
Flying Dutchman: Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity.
Mr. Krabs: [Frantically]Mommy!
Flying Dutchman: Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap.
Mr. Krabs: You have me word as a sailor. [scene cuts to the dilapidated Krusty Krab where a sign hangs over it that says 'Out of Business']
Squidward: [looking through Mr. Krabs desk drawers] Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these. [SpongeBob is wearing his hat and holding his spatula, crying]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings. [sniffs] He won't like it!
Squidward: SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back. [Wears a stethoscope. Tries to open the safe, putting a stethoscope onto the safe to avoid suspicion.] Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe. [Mr. Krabs walks in]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boys! [SpongeBob screams with joy as Squidward sheepishly hides his stethoscope behind his back]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive! [clings to Mr. Krabs happily] Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?
Squidward: [Deadpan]Well, it was.
Mr. Krabs: You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money, [mimics being infatuated to money] touching money... [returns back to normal talking] Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs. [scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where a giant 'Grand Re-Opening' sign is hanging. 'Buy' and 'Free' signs are in the window] Welcome all, welcome! [a little kid walks up to Krabs] Hello, little one. What you got there?
Monroe: A Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?
Monroe: I don't go hungry?
Mr. Krabs: No, silly! It means free toy! [gives him a little toy]
Monroe: Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.
Mr. Krabs: I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills! [everyone cheers. Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob] Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?
SpongeBob: Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'. [scene cuts to Squidward sleeping peacefully in a bed in Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: [Joyfully] Great!
Martha: Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes sir. [takes the patty and lifts the top bun where a disclaimer, written in ketchup form, is shown] Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is hisher responsibility...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [puts down the bun] That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir. [goes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Sorry about the confusion. [pulls out a toy] Free toy? [Martha takes it, looking confused]
Squidward: Eugene, my man.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! How's the break coming?
Squidward: Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you? [Winks then walks off]
Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy. [walks up to a customer watching a movie on a small television hanging from the ceiling] Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?
Harold: This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!
Mr. Krabs: [pats the customer on the back] No expense spared for my valued customers. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob standing in front of the restaurant] Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
Squidward: [walks in with some envelopes] Here's your mail, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.
Squidward: Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me. [stretches and yawns a little]
Mr. Krabs: Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is. [opens the envelope] Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad. [runs up to the cash register] I'll just subtract it from today's profit. [opens the register, but it's empty] And... there's no money in here. [laughs] How delightful.
SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Me, too. How are we gonna get paid? [both walk up to Mr. Krabs] Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon. [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other surprised]
Squidward: Uh... "dream"?
Mr. Krabs: Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!
SpongeBob: Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.
Squidward: Here's the bill. [hands Mr. Krabs the bill from earlier]
Mr. Krabs: You mean... I'm awake? [he screams as his head cracks through the middle over and over. Each time he cracks his head open, a new one appears. He races up to Nat drinking a Mountain Dew-like drink and he confiscates it from him] No more refills! [takes it to the soda machine and the drink gets sucked back into it like a vacuum. Then he runs up to two kids playing with toys. He steals them also.] Give me back them toys, you freeloaders! [He then runs back over to Harold watching the movie earlier] Show's over, cheapskate! [turns the TV off then presses a button that erases his memory of the movie. Harold goes dizzy.]
Nathiel Waters: Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny! [reaches for the penny]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs a hold of the customer's arm] Your luck just ran out!
Nathiel Waters: Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.
Mr. Krabs: Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off. [Flying Dutchman reappears. The customer runs away]
Flying Dutchman: A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity!
Mr. Krabs: I'm not cheap, I'm generous!
Squidward: You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically] Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you. [Flying Dutchman picks him up] Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.
SpongeBob: Wait just a burger-flipping second!
[Flying Dutchman turns around]
Flying Dutchman: Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?
SpongeBob: That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea. [Mr. Krabs is happy at SpongeBob's words]
Flying Dutchman: He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.
SpongeBob: I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
Flying Dutchman: You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?
Mr. Krabs: That depends, how much money we talking about?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Flying Dutchman: [shows money] 62 cents.
Mr. Krabs: I'll take the money.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Flying Dutchman: Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents. [hands him the change and picks up SpongeBob] Next stop: Davy Jones' locker! [SpongeBob screams as they both disappear]
Mr. Krabs: [Runs to Squidward, happy] Look, Squidward, money!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?
Mr. Krabs: You think I could've gotten more?
Squidward: He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!
Mr. Krabs: [Briefly looks at his change in a sad way until he starts to cry.] Oh, what have I done? [cries] I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money! [throws the change on the ground] I want SpongeBob back! [Flying Dutchman reappears and drops SpongeBob on the floor]
Flying Dutchman: Here, take him back.
Mr. Krabs: You heard what I said about the money?
Flying Dutchman: Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Flying Dutchman at Davy Jones' locker with SpongeBob talking a lot] And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!
SpongeBob: [In the Davy Jones' locker scene, talking simultaneously with the Flying Dutchman's explanations, talking super quickly] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!
Flying Dutchman: He's your problem now. [laughs evilly as he disappears]
Mr. Krabs: Heh, about trading you for pocket change...
SpongeBob: Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.
Mr. Krabs: You would have?
SpongeBob: No. [all laugh. Scene cuts to the Flying Dutchman sitting on a chair, reading a book until the phone rings]
Flying Dutchman: [picks up phone] Dutchman's residence.
SpongeBob: [on the other end, talking super quickly] So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work. [Flying Dutchman groans] I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.
Patrick: [screaming while flying on his sandboard, then bashes his body on mountain. The word “DEAD” flashes, also making a "dead" sound effect]
[Screen zooms out, revealing that Patrick is only playing a video game with his character while sandboarding down Sand Mountain]
Patrick: Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks. [hits a rock and flies and screams then bashes his body on mountain just like on his game]
Sandy: See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.
SpongeBob: I'm listening to you, mountain! [starts sandboarding, and he passes by Patrick's legs] Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, yeah, I forgot. [eats yellow sand on a plate]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, watch me do the "Grouchy Squidward".
Squidward: [sits at a table drinking tea close to the mountain] Stop naming moves after me!
SpongeBob: [imitating Squidward] Everybody's an idiot except for me.
Squidward: Well, it's true. [takes a sip]
[SpongeBob laughs like Squidward, Sandy and Patrick laugh with him]
Sandy: [stops laughing and gasps] SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!
SpongeBob: [stops laughing like Squidward] Huh? [avoids tree with scuba diving gear on it] Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, ‘cause I'm an... [hits a log and he goes off the mountain] Expert...! [suddenly stops in mid-air] Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down! [camera reveals that SpongeBob is upside down and not the mountain and he screams as he falls]
Sandy: SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!
SpongeBob: [makes himself right-side up and he takes off his pants] Like this?
Patrick: No, your other bottom!
Sandy: Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?
Patrick: Not until 4.
[SpongeBob crashes into the ground and his bottom breaks into tiny pieces]
Sandy: Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
Patrick: Do it again! I wasn't looking!
[Cuts to the doctor's office]
Doctor: Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.
SpongeBob: My what has a what now?
Doctor: Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing. [he turns an x-ray on] It took twenty hours to put it all back together. [he holds a stapler] We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick [he holds a glue stick]. Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there. [points to where the fish is] [we see Tom and his butt is in a giant machine] In the Iron Butt.
Tom: [in the Iron Butt] Aww, man. It itches.
SpongeBob: [outside hospital] You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol. [sees Harold behind him] Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!
Harold: What's your problem? [leaves SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Whew. That was close.
Football Player: Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player. [another football player catches a football] Nice catch, Percy! [slaps Percy's bottom, SpongeBob cringes as he holds his butt]
Jimmy: Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams as he turns around, while holding his butt] You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine! [crawls between people's legs, who each take turns spanking his butt] Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.
Martin: Next. 
SpongeBob: No. [screams as he runs off. Everybody looks at him]
Squidward: Is this where the line starts? 
SpongeBob: My butt is not safe out here! [runs inside his house and closes the door] No part of me is safe! [closes the window curtain] 
[Patrick and Sandy return from another trip from Sand Mountain] 
Sandy: Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy! [Patrick starts laughing as they enter SpongeBob's house] Hey, SpongeBob! 
Patrick: [is still laughing while riding on Sandy's back; Sandy glares at him and he gets off her back as well as clearing his throat afterwards] That was fun. [he stops smiling] 
Sandy: [Patrick smiles again] Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob? 
[SpongeBob is sitting in a fetal position in the middle of the floor, with a penny, a potato chip, and a wadded-up napkin lying on the floor in front of him] 
SpongeBob: [with a little smile on his face] Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world? 
Sandy: Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that? 
SpongeBob: Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again. 
Sandy: That's crazy talk! 
Patrick: That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk. [does various forms of gibberish blabbing, but his third blabbing makes his saliva hit Sandy, making her hammer-fist him to shut him up, bashing his head in] Sorry. 
SpongeBob: No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead. 
Patrick: Or your other armpit! 
SpongeBob: I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary. 
Sandy: Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome? 
SpongeBob: I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny... [holds up a penny] and Chip... [holds up a potato chip] and say hello to Used Napkin. [holds up a used napkin] 
Sandy: Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab? 
SpongeBob: No problem! [he grabs the end of a spatula, which is so long it stretches all the way inside the Krusty Krab] A really long spatula. [flips a patty with the really long spatula] 
Sandy: What about eating? 
SpongeBob: I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed. [breathes in a different and weird way] 
Sandy: SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside! 
SpongeBob: Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again. 
Patrick: Never ever? 
SpongeBob: Never ever ever! 
Patrick: Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?! 
SpongeBob: Never ever never never ever ever never!! 
Patrick: Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?! 
SpongeBob: [sighs exasperatedly] Never ever... 
SpongeBob and Patrick: Never never never never ever never ever never… 
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door? [throws Chip to the door, opening it, and Patrick and an angry Sandy leave] 
Patrick: Thank you, Chip. [closes the door. Outside, Sandy is still glaring at SpongeBob] I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward! 
Squidward: [pops out of his window] No! [slams his window shut] 
Patrick: Aww! 
Sandy: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of. 
Patrick: And that's when I [holds a boxing glove] punch him, right? [Sandy gives a bummed look. Patrick and Sandy are jellyfishing outside SpongeBob's house] 
Sandy: Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun. 
Patrick: [catches a jellyfish] I caught one! [puts head in net and his jellyfish sticks to his face] Huh? 
SpongeBob: [Patrick gets electrocuted in the background, making him scream in pain] Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting. [puts on a pair of glasses and a tiny net and waves it in the air] I think I caught one! 
Sandy: We've got to try something else! 
[Patrick and Sandy are holding a cake in front of SpongeBob's house] 
Sandy and Patrick: ♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob! Three cheers for you!♪ 
Sandy: Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish. 
SpongeBob: I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny! [the penny lies silently on the floor] 
Patrick: [sniffles] That penny has the most beautiful voice. 
Sandy: [goes inside the window to angrily point at a smiling SpongeBob] That is it, SquarePants! We're gonna find you something that's so dang fun that you'll have to come outside! [goes outside] 
Sandy: [jumps on a trampoline] Trampoline! 
Patrick: [holds an ice cream cone] Ice cream. 
Sandy: [surfs on an underwater wave] Underwater surfing! 
Patrick: [holds two ice cream cones] Two ice creams. 
Sandy: [rides on a Ferris wheel] Ferris wheel! 
Patrick: [the two ice creams are melting] Still two ice creams. 
Sandy: [struggling with a giant clam] Clam wrestling! 
Patrick: [washes an old man in a tub] Washing an old person. 
Sandy: Patrick, that's not fun. 
Old man: It is for me! 
[SpongeBob is still "filter-feeding", and Sandy and Patrick watch him through his window] 
Sandy: Nothing's working, Patrick! 
Patrick: What do we do? 
Old man: [appearing from below] I say we take a bath! 
Sandy: Wha...will you get out of here? 
[Patrick and Sandy are hiding behind a coral bush and Patrick is in a gorilla suit] 
Sandy: Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal. 
Patrick: Right. [he zips up his mask] 
Sandy: [opens the door] All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat! [Patrick comes out in the gorilla suit and acts crazy like a gorilla] Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year. 
Sandy: [Patrick continues dancing] No, really! You've got to come and save me! [Suddenly, a second Patrick shows up out of nowhere with an ice cream] 
Patrick #2: Hey, Sandy, [SpongeBob gives a startled look] who's your friend?
Sandy: [Confused] But you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.
Patrick #1: I am in the gorilla suit. [unzips the gorilla suit] I thought I was doing a pretty good job.
Sandy: If you're Patrick, then who's that? [The two look at second Patrick who unzips his head, which reveals a real gorilla underneath which scares them!] Ah! A real gorilla!
SpongeBob: '[Shocked] Huh?! [The gorilla rips out of the Patrick suit it is wearing. Sandy and Patrick are screaming. The gorilla grabs the scared Patrick and Sandy, puts them in a bag, and repeatedly beats them] Oh, my gosh! [Sandy and Patrick are still screaming while the gorilla beats them] This can't be happening! [The gorilla hits Patrick and Sandy using a chair, then beating them some more] This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about! [the gorilla can be seen still beating up the sack outside the window; it also does things like dribbling the sack and bouncing on it like it's a ball] Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.
Gary: [eats Chip, killing him] Meow.
SpongeBob: [looks behind] Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world. [gulps and shakes as he reaches for the door. The door shakes as well until SpongeBob opens it] I'm taking my [walks slowly] first step. [continues walking] So far, so good. I think I can do this! [the wind blows a piece of paper onto his face; SpongeBob screams] Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me! [Squidward waters his plants and rolls his eyes and SpongeBob removes the paper off his face] I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now! [the gorilla grabs SpongeBob] Is it too late to go back inside again? [the gorilla rips SpongeBob in half]
1st half of SpongeBob: It's too late. [the gorilla screeches] Patrick? Sandy?
Patrick and Sandy: [still in the bag] Yes, SpongeBob?
1st half of SpongeBob: I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.
Sandy: [shaken] Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.
First half of SpongeBob: You know what I don't understand though? [moves to the second half of SpongeBob]
Second half of SpongeBob: What?
First half of SpongeBob: What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place? [the gorilla's eyes widen]
Gorilla: [man's voice] Oh! Well, it's funny you should, uh, you see, George, they're on to us! [A zebra rushes onto the screen]
George: Let's get outta here! [the gorilla gets on George and rides away with him. Patrick, Sandy, and the two halves of SpongeBob are watching the gorilla ride on George into the sunset. The screen zooms out to reveal a family watching the episode on TV in bemusement. The father turns to the mother and gives her a confused look, he shakes his head, and turns off the TV]
SpongeBob: [reads the newspaper while sipping a drink] Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.
Gary: [sitting at the counter] Meow.
SpongeBob: [puts on his hat] Well, time to punch that clock.<br >[walks into his living room] But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.<br >[calendar reads "June 21"] You are a winner.<br >[hugs himself then looks back at the calendar and gasps] And today's the first day of summer!<br >[cut to the Krusty Krab where the bored Squidward is at the register. SpongeBob walks through the doors with a pink flower around his head. He tosses flower petals into the air]<br >Happy first day of summer, Squidward!<br >[walks over to Squidward] Care to join me for solstice caroling?<br >[sings in a high voice]<br >Walking in the grass,<br >it's so fine,<br >don't need shoes<br >in the summertime!<br >[tosses flower petals at Squidward]
Squidward: I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: [does a few back flips in the air] Whee-hoo! [runs over to the window]
SpongeBob: [walks up to him] Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever! [turns around] What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?
Mr. Krabs: The money!
SpongeBob: The money?
Mr. Krabs: Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!
SpongeBob: Oh.
Mr. Krabs: You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break. [sits down on a barrel and SpongeBob sits on his lap]
SpongeBob: Tell me more about summer break. [a school bell rings and all the kids run out of the school]
Mr. Krabs: Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance. [a child runs by with a full pocket of coins] Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever. [pulls down a menu] I guess that's what I like best. [puts a sticker labeled '4.99' next to the Kiddie Meal] Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal. [goes over to the front window] Come here, you little piggies!
SpongeBob: I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
Narrator: Later... [Mr. Krabs is still standing at the window with the same expression on his face]
SpongeBob: [walks up] Almost closing time, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs: What? But that's impossible. [sobs] What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children? [SpongeBob shrugs as Mr. Krabs sighs] I guess summer isn't coming this year.
SpongeBob: Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there. [points at a playground where kids are playing]
Mr. Krabs: Playground? Luring away me young customers? Warm up the boat, SpongeBob. [cut to the playground. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs pull up in their boat. They peek out using a pair of binoculars]
SpongeBob: See anything, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob. [two kids are swinging] So weak and malnourished. [one of the kids is eating a lollipop] With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing. [a kid slides down a slide] Breaks me heart. [cries] No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
Mr. Krabs: True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do. [drives off]
SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey! [cut to SpongeBob walking to the Krusty Krab] Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment. [stares at something in the distance] Huh? [a group of kids are lined up at the Krusty Krab where a sign reads "Krabby Land" is hanging. A giant sheet is covering some sort of area. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [sticks the hammer in his belt] You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!
SpongeBob: Krabby Land, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, Krabby Land! [holds up a sign] Where a kid can have fun... for the right price. [laughs] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?
Monroe: Monroe.
Mr. Krabs: Nice to meet you, Monroe. [picks him up and laughs]
Monroe: Whee!
Mr. Krabs: [shakes Monroe and hears change in his pocket] Mmm... a-ha! [his pupils become dollar signs] Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land! [the kids cheer] Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.
Kids: We promise.
Mr. Krabs: All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land! [pulls off the sheet that covered the play area]
Kids: Yeah! [kids' cheers soon turn into frowns and shocked expressions. The play area is a bunch of cheap rides that break down. Tyler tries a slide but it collapses as he tries it]
Tyler: Whoa! Ooh, where am I?
Mr. Krabs: Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring booksliability waivers! [holds up a stack of paper] Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!
Kids: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties. [holds up a Krabby Patty] Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.
Kids: We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!
SpongeBob: [while kids are chanting "We want Krabby" eight times] Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.
SpongeBob: Stall 'em? How do I do that?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. Be entertaining. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [turns around and sees the kids, angry; he laughs nervously and waves] Hey, kids!
Monroe: You're not Krabby the Clown.
SpongeBob: No, I'm not. I'm, uh... [puts on a mask] I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
Tyler: Lame.
SpongeBob: Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? [picks up a bubble wand]
Monroe: No.
SpongeBob: Well, you've never seen my bubbles. [blows a jellyfish bubble] Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
Tyler: Still lame. [bubble pops]
SpongeBob: [dips wand again] Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins. [blows a seahorse bubble] Ta-da! [Tyler pops the bubble] Uh... huh.
Kids: You stink! Bring on the clown!
SpongeBob: Okay, uh... and now for a finale! [starts blowing a bubble]
Kids: Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!
SpongeBob: [the bubble pops in his eyes making it red. He screams] My eyes! [scream and trips over a barrel] Whoa! [crashes into The Pit of Doom which is actually a dumpster then swings over a tire. Lands in a pool of bowling balls then the tire lands on him. Kids start to laugh SpongeBob then begins to think...] [Inner Monologue] They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery. [Normal speech] Hey, kids, check this out. [picks up his bubble wand and dips it in the bubble soap then throws the wand away. Pours all the bubble soap in his eyes which swell up and he screams]
Kids: Woo-hoo!
SpongeBob: I got 'em right where I want 'em. [SpongeBob puts a piece of tape on his face and rips it off, revealing a portion of his face is missing and he screams]
Kids: Woo-hoo! Yeah!
SpongeBob: [lies on the ground with his tongue sticking out. A truck runs over his tongue over and over and he screams]
Kids: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha! [SpongeBob walks up to a muscular guy and hands him some money. The muscular guy hits him with a big hammer. SpongeBob gives the thumbs up] Yeah, woo! [muscular guy smashes SpongeBob with a wrecking ball] Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gives a thumbs-up. Later, SpongeBob is tied to two poles with a muscular guy holding a can of lima beans; screams as muscular guy shoves a spoonful of lima beans in SpongeBob’s mouth. All the kids cheer]
Kids: [laughing]
SpongeBob: [being used as a ball in the two muscular guys' ping pong game] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Kids: Yay! [SpongeBob’s arms are getting stretched by two muscular guys] Yeah! [SpongeBob is in two pieces but gives two thumbs up. Cut to Mr. Krabs' office where he is counting the money he has received from the kids. SpongeBob enters his office in pieces]
SpongeBob: Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
Mr. Krabs: Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?
SpongeBob: The kids are using them as... boomerangs. [one of SpongeBob’s legs flies in and back out]
Mr. Krabs: Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!
SpongeBob: What are we gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!
SpongeBob: [hops on top of the table] Really? He's here? [bounces up and down] Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
Mr. Krabs: Get out there and tell 'em!
SpongeBob: [walks outside] Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
Kids: Yay!
SpongeBob: Who do you want?
Kids: Krabby!
SpongeBob: When do you want him?
Kids: Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby! [all running up to Mr. Krabs] Krabby! Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?
Kids and SpongeBob: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: All right, here you go! [turns around with a blue nose and tie on] Hey, kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties! [laughs and walks back toward his office, leaving the children including SpongeBob puzzled] Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!
SpongeBob: I'll say you have.
Mr. Krabs: [turns around] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [frowning while almost in tears] How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, I ain't cheap! [takes off his fake nose and rubs the blue paint off it] Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.
SpongeBob: But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?
Mr. Krabs: [walks to the window] The children? I don't care about the children! [starts to climb out the window] I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose! [climbs out] Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest. [laughs]
Kid: Ahem.
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [angry children are standing behind him] Oh, hey kids. [smiles nervously] Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.
Monroe: Get him! [all the kids run after him]
SpongeBob: [inside, sounds of Mr. Krabs getting beat up by the kids is heard as SpongeBob sighs] I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.
Squidward: You mean this morning?
SpongeBob: Yeah. [a noise is heard outside]
Monroe: Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!
Kids: [money is falling from the sky] Yay! Hooray!
SpongeBob: Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.
Kids: Hooray! [a kid on top of the Krusty Krab is throwing money down]
SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.
Mr. Krabs: [is tied to poles like SpongeBob was earlier] Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff! [a muscular guy places a spoon of lima beans in front of him] No! Not that green stuff! [a lima bean truck backs up] Noooooooooo!
Squidward: [enters his bedroom in nightgown, with book, and cup of tea] Ahh, finally, the weekend is here. And this isn't just any old weekend. [gestures to "Dance Quarterly" calendar on wall] This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back? [thought bubble appears over Squidward]
SpongeBob: [in Squidward's thoughts, walking along with Patrick, both have camping gear strapped to their backs] Patrick, I'm scared! [thought bubble disappears]
Squidward: Ho-ho, that would be great! [jumps into bed] You've waited a long time for this! A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no... [laughs just like SpongeBob and imitates his goofy, big-eyed face] [hears SpongeBob's real laugh outside] What the...? [goes outside to find SpongeBob and Patrick in a tent, complete with sleeping bags and books, the two are laughing] SpongeBob! Aren't you two supposed to be camping?
SpongeBob: We are camping.
Squidward: SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house. [camera zooms out to show tent's location]
SpongeBob: Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside. [Squidward leaves; SpongeBob and Patrick pull their book back out, along with a flashlight, and begin to read and giggle]
Squidward: [pops back into tent, glaring] What do you mean, "have fun inside"?
SpongeBob: Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow.
Squidward: Oh. Bye. [exits; SpongeBob and Patrick resume reading; Squidward enters tent again and gasps] You little sneak! I see what you're doing!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Don't think I can't see what you're doing!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: You're saying I can't take it!
SpongeBob: But all I...
Squidward: [holds up tentacle] Aah. You're saying I'm soft! You think your little "have fun inside" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it! [exits tent]
SpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside!
Squidward: [pokes head back into tent, blowing SpongeBob and Patrick back with his loud voice] That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping! [runs into his house]
SpongeBob: [to Patrick] Squidward's gonna come camping with us! [both climb out of tent and giggle]
Squidward: [emerges with large camping backpack] Now you'll see how a real... ugh! [falls face forward on the ground, squished by the immense backpack] ...outdoorsman does it! [climbs out from underneath; pulls pouch from backpack] Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn. [SpongeBob takes out binoculars, Patrick a notepad and a pair of half-moon glasses; Squidward tosses pouch into the air and presses the remote, but the power fizzles and the tent appears, unassembled in a pile on the ground]
SpongeBob: That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?
Patrick: Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.
Squidward: It isn't put up yet, you idiots! [grumbles, picking up the tent and fiddling around with it and accidentally rips it]
SpongeBob: [still acting like he and Patrick are taking notes] Customization!
Patrick: Genius!
[Squidward beats on the tent with a wooden stick]
SpongeBob: He's tenderizing the ground!
Patrick: Of course!
[Squidward is still struggling with the tent]
SpongeBob: Write that down, write that down! [Patrick still appears to be taking notes, but there is just a tic-tac-toe game in progress on his notepad]
Squidward: [gives the pile a huge kick; it automatically becomes an assembled tent] Huh? Voila! [the perfect tent collapses to pile form again; Squidward pushes it out of the way] But what could compare to just lying out under the stars? [takes a lone blanket and places it on the ground; SpongeBob and Patrick applaud vigorously] Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows. [pulls out "Marsh King" bag and pops a marshmallow into his mouth] Mmm... just like the astronauts eat.
Patrick: [has round fishbowl over his head like the helmet of an astronaut suit; imitates static noise] Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.
SpongeBob: [also has "helmet". imitates static noise] SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.
Patrick: [static] Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going [static]. Over.
SpongeBob: [static] SpongeBob to Patrick. [static] Me too. [Patrick and SpongeBob start to repeatedly exchange static noises. Squidward is annoyed.] SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over. [holds out Marsh King bag]
Patrick: Yummy! [takes marshmallow and crams it into his mouth, smashing his "helmet"] Patrick to SpongeBob. The deliciousness has landed!
Squidward: Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls [holds up can so we can read its label], just as soon as I can get my can opener.
SpongeBob: But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?
Squidward: Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.
SpongeBob: But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.
Patrick: Pretty weenie!
Squidward: All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.
[Squidward begins toasting his marshmallow lightly. Patrick, sitting across from him, sets his on fire and tries to blow on it to cool it down, but the marshmallow flies off and hits Squidward in the face. Patrick gets another marshmallow and repeats the same thing twice. After two marshmallows to the face, Squidward ducks, but the third marshmallow has a boomerang effect and hits Squidward in the back of the head]
Squidward: Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?
SpongeBob: Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one "The Campfire Song Song". ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪
Patrick: ♪Bum! Bum! Bum!♪
Both: [Patrick slightly behind SpongeBob in the words] ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪
SpongeBob: ♪And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong! But it'll help if you just sing along...♪
Patrick: ♪Sing another song...♪
SpongeBob: ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪ Patrick!
Patrick: ♪SONG! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E...♪
SpongeBob: Squidward! [silence] Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪ [SpongeBob smashes his ukulele like a guitar at the end of a rock show. Patrick does the same with his drum set] ♪Oh yeah!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?
Squidward: No! This is relaxing. [holds up clarinet and begins playing "Kumbaya"; SpongeBob and Patrick look alarmed]
SpongeBob: Oh no! I'll save you, Squidward! [picks up marshmallow and slingshots it at Squidward; it goes up his clarinet and sticks in the back of his throat; SpongeBob comes over to assist him] Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?
Squidward: Better?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!
SpongeBob: But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.
Squidward: [in a low, cautious tone] A sea bear? You mean like the ones that... [In an angry tone] don't exist?!
SpongeBob: What are you saying?
Squidward: There's no such thing! They're just a myth.
SpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real. It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer. [holds up cheesy tabloid newspaper]
Squidward: [reads cover story] "I Married a Sea Bear"?
Patrick: Yeah! And Fake Science Monthly! [holds up newspaper]
Squidward: [reads] "Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real"? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!
Patrick: Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!
SpongeBob: Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin...
Squidward: You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?
SpongeBob: Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet.
Squidward: Okay. Then what?
SpongeBob: Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.
Patrick: Flashlights are their natural prey.
Squidward: You're kidding.
SpongeBob: Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.
Patrick: Yeah.
Squidward:  [writes on notepad] Go on.
SpongeBob: Don't ever eat cheese.
Squidward: Sliced or cubed?
SpongeBob: [whispers with Patrick] Cubed. Sliced is fine.
Squidward: Yeah, yeah, and?
SpongeBob: Never wear a sombrero...
Patrick: ...in a goofy fashion!
SpongeBob: Or clown shoes.
Patrick: Or a hoop skirt.
SpongeBob: And never...
Patrick: Ever...
SpongeBob: Ever...
Patrick: Duh!
Both: ...screech like a chimpanzee!
Squidward: Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off! 
Both: [huddling together, shuddering] They're horrible!
Squidward: And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger.
Both: Why?
Squidward: I don't know... [runs off and returns with a flashlight, clown shoes, hoop skirt, sombrero, and tray full of cubed cheese; a diabolical look is on his face] Just a feeling!
SpongeBob: [horrified] No.
Squidward: Yes.
SpongeBob: No.
[Squidward begins making chimp noises] 
Both: Squidward, please don't! 
[Squidward continues hooting, stomping, and waving flashlight around]
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt. [takes stick and draws circle around himself and Patrick] 
Patrick: Good thinking! All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.
Squidward: [laughing] You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up? 
SpongeBob: Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.
Squidward: Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this? [Squidward tilts his sombrero to the right, laughing, but something off-screen takes the hat and turns it upside-down instead] 
SpongeBob: No. Like that.
[camera zooms out to show the sea bear that inverted Squidward's sombrero; it looks like a giant fish with the head of a bear and claws on its fins. Squidward sees The sea bear and screams while it roars and chases him while he runs; it begins to maul [off-camera] the screaming Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick are still huddled inside their anti-sea-bear circle]
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you okay?
Squidward: [looking bruised and battered] No.
SpongeBob: Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back!
Patrick: Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.
Squidward: Are you crazy?! A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!
Both: No!
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
SpongeBob: Don't run! Sea bears hate that!
Squidward: Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.
Both: No!
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
SpongeBob: They hate limping more than running!
Squidward: Well, I guess I'll just have...
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
SpongeBob: I should have warned you about crawling.
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
Squidward: What'd I do that time?!
SpongeBob: I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.
Patrick: Pretend to be somebody else!
SpongeBob: Here, draw a circle. [tosses Squidward the stick]
Squidward: Okay.
[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward]
SpongeBob: That was an oval. It has to be a circle!
Squidward: [runs and climbs on top of SpongeBob and Patrick, who are still sitting in the circle] Move over! [the sea bear comes up to Squidward in the circle, sees it, snarls as it points a threatening claw at Squidward, and leaves] Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life! [everyone cheers "hooray"]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros!
Squidward: What attracts them?
Patrick: The sound of a sea bear attack.
[a sea rhinoceros appears, snorting]
SpongeBob: Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?
Squidward: [Nervously]  Uh huh.
SpongeBob: Wait for it... [clock changes to 8:00. SpongeBob punches in then jumps in the air. The scene pauses him in mid-air]
Automated Voice: On Time Percentage: 100%. [the scene starts again. Squidward walks up to the time clock]
Squidward: Another day, another migraine. Heh, heh, mi... [scene pauses again]
Automated Voice: On Time Percentage: 12%. [the screen un-pauses]
Squidward: ...graine. Heh, heh, heh.
SpongeBob: Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?
Squidward: Yeah, great.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Aww, yeah.
Squidward: [getting annoyed] Yes!
SpongeBob: Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest. [laughs. SpongeBob walks out with a bag and a long, pointy tool] Litter. [picks up trash] Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper? [laughs] Kids these days. [another piece of trash falls to the ground next to him. He gasps and he picks up the trash] I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now. [more trash keeps falling to the ground around him and he picks them up quickly. He breathes, exhausted, as one more piece of litter falls down attached to a parachute. He finally snaps] Where is all this litter coming from?! [SpongeBob notices someone tossing trash out of a car] Not on my watch. [walks up to the car] Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.
Strangler: Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police? [police arrive]
SpongeBob: Yes. [police begin to handcuff the Strangler. They walk past him in single-file and continue cuffing him]
Squidward: How's it going, Lieutenant?
SpongeBob: Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts. [laughs] Yeah, just desserts.
Squidward: Whatever. Huh? [notices the Strangler] SpongeBob, don't you know who that is?
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: That's the Tattletale Strangler.
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: The Tattletale Strangler! [shows SpongeBob a 'WANTED' poster of the Strangler] He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in! [Strangler growls. SpongeBob and Squidward are scared]
SpongeBob: He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward? [Squidward's gone] Squidward? Squidward?
Officer Johnson: You're gonna do time, Strangler. Hard time. [SpongeBob walks up to the police]
SpongeBob: Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?
Officer Nancy: Who, Strangler?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Strangler.
Officer Nancy: Oh, yeah, he's going to jail for a long time. [Strangler draws on the back of the driver's seat headrest, and flips it to reveal an exact likeness of SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Hey, that looks like me! [Strangler growls and attacks the headrest, "killing" the SpongeBob drawing, and chuckles evilly. SpongeBob screams]
Officer Nancy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. He won't be able to strangle you.
Officer Johnson: Yeah. We got him chained up real good. He'll never get away.
Officer Nancy: Oops, not again. [Strangler is gone, with his handcuffs in his place in the car]
Officer Johnson: Yep, he got away. [SpongeBob screams then falls over]
SpongeBob: You nice officers will protect me, right?
Officer Nancy: We ain't bodyguards, kid.
Officer Johnson: Yeah, give us a call if you see him again... tattletale. [they drive off, leaving dust that makes SpongeBob cough]
SpongeBob: Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard! [runs into the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'.  When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?
SpongeBob: This would be him, Mr. Krabs. [takes out the wanted poster of The Strangler]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps in fear] The Tattletale Strangler?! [his appendages go into his body] Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you! [scene cuts to SpongeBob showing the wanted poster to people. Shows it to Larry, who turns into a real lobster on a plate, then a construction worker who pogos off on his jackhammer, and some guys at the Tough Tavern who run off, some screaming "HOLD ME! HOLD ME!", leaving SpongeBob distraught]
SpongeBob: [at the bus stop] Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard. [Strangler sits on a bench reading a newspaper]
Strangler: Bodyguard, huh? I might be able to help you out. [SpongeBob walks over]
SpongeBob: You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture. [holds up the wanted poster. The Strangler reveals himself wearing a fake mustache]
Strangler: Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough.
SpongeBob: I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty. [Strangler shows his filthy hands and laughs. Before the Strangler starts to strangle SpongeBob, a bus stops next to them and the Strangler puts his hands behind his back and smiles, as the bus drives off]
Strangler: Huh? Uh-oh. Uh, there's too many witnesses around here. [walks up to SpongeBob] Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card. [Shows SpongeBob his drawn-over fake ID card]
SpongeBob: Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next? [a five cent sticker is hanging from the Strangler's fake mustache]
Strangler: Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man. [he points to an old man with a walker] Or that baby. [points to a baby in a stroller]
SpongeBob: Or that pebble. [points to a small rock on the ground] Or that stick. [points to a stick on the ground] Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium. [points to a white piece of paper]
Strangler: Huh? Uhh, that's mine. [picks it up and puts it in his pocket]
SpongeBob: Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?
Strangler: Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...
SpongeBob: We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
Strangler: Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected. [laughs as the lights grow dim] Perfect. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Yes, excellent. [laughs with the Strangler until the lights turn on again] Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.
Strangler: Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.
SpongeBob: Quick is my middle name. [scene cuts to the grocery store] Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?
Strangler: Whatever gets us to your house quicker.
SpongeBob: I'll take both! [scene cuts to 'Dry Cleaning While-U-Wait']
Dry Cleaner: Here you go, Mr. SquarePants. [he hands him his clothes]
SpongeBob: Hmmm.
Dry Cleaner: Is there something wrong?
SpongeBob: I'm not sure if these are my pants. [Strangler groans. Scene cuts to the perfume store where SpongeBob sprays some perfume on his wrist and holds it up to the Strangler] How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?
Strangler: Can we just go to your house?! [scene cuts to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Here we are. SquarePants Manor. Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.
Strangler: All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...
SpongeBob: Protect me?
Strangler: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Don't mention it, Strangler. [gasps] I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key? [searches his pocket for the key as the Strangler gets angry]
Narrator: Twenty minutes later... [SpongeBob is still searching for his key. The Strangler gets even more angry]
SpongeBob: Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?
Strangler: Oh, forget the key! Let's climb through this window. [struggles reaching for the window] I can't reach it. Do you think you could hop up on my shoulders, kid?  [SpongeBob is wearing cleats]
SpongeBob: Sure. With these spiky cleats, anything is possible. [jumps onto the Strangler] Ya.
Strangler: Cleats?! [SpongeBob's feet land on the Strangler's eyeballs. The Strangler screams in pain] Get your feet out of my eye sockets! [SpongeBob starts tugging at his legs]
SpongeBob: I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas! [Strangler runs around in pain]
Narrator: Six hours later... [Strangler is still running around until he pulls SpongeBob's feet out of his eyes. Scene cuts to the Strangler with bandages on his eyes]
SpongeBob: Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside. [The Strangler's eyes open widely. The Strangler growls in anger and a nuclear explosion comes out of his head] There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door. [Strangler sneaks up behind SpongeBob ready to strangle him. SpongeBob opens the door and walks in] Step inside...
Strangler: [closes the door] Close the door...
SpongeBob: Well, here we are.
Strangler: I've finally got you all alone! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: I know, isn't it great? [laughs. Strangler picks up SpongeBob] Ooh.
Strangler: Now, you're gonna get yours... tattletale! [lights turn on]
All of SpongeBob's friends: Surprise! [all of SpongeBob's friends are in his house cheering. They drop a sign that says 'Congratulations, SpongeBob! 100% On Time!']
SpongeBob: A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work? [Strangler nervously places his hands behind his back] Oh, how'd you guys know?
Patrick: It's on the invitations you sent us. [holds an invitation up] Let's boogie! [everyone parties. The Strangler sits down in SpongeBob's chair. Scene cuts to the end of the party]
SpongeBob: Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest. [everyone else leaves and he walks back into the house and laughs] Ahh, alone at last.
Strangler: [wakes up] What? Huh? Huh? What? Huh? [SpongeBob closes the door] So, we're all alone now?
SpongeBob: Just you, me, and the floorboards. [Strangler and SpongeBob begin laughing again] Yeah. [there's a knock on the door. SpongeBob opens it]
All: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: How did you guys know today is my birthday?
Patrick: We just do what the invitations say. Let's boogie some more! [everyone parties again and the Strangler walks back to SpongeBob's chair. Scene cuts to the end of the party]
SpongeBob: Thanks for coming! [closes the door. Laughs] Alone again.
Strangler: Is it true? Everybody's gone?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Strangler: No, no more parties today? You got everything you need now? Nobody's left? We're completely alone?
SpongeBob: Oh yeah.
Strangler: In that case... [laughs evilly until Patrick appears out of nowhere]
Patrick: Great parties, huh?
Strangler: Oh... sorry, Tubby, you've gotta go. [carries Patrick away]
SpongeBob: Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
Strangler: Well, I can't take any chances. For all we know, he could be the Strangler.
Patrick: I'm the Strangler? Oh, I should've known! I gotta turn myself in! [runs and breaks through the wall]
SpongeBob: So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.
Strangler: [growls] HE’S NOT THE STRANGLER!!!!!!
SpongeBob: He's not?
Strangler: [rips off his fake mustache] I AM!!!!
SpongeBob: Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?
Strangler: Oh, It's a fake, you idiot!! I bought it at the party store!! [everyone comes back inside]
Squidward: Did someone say 'party'? [Strangler screams and runs out through the wall]
Strangler: I can't take it!
SpongeBob: [runs after him] Wait, bodyguard, I need protection! [Strangler gets into a taxi]
Strangler: Step on it! I'm being chased by a maniac! [SpongeBob chases after the taxi]
SpongeBob: I'm not safe! Come back! [taxi goes to the Bikini Bottom Airport and an airplane takes off]
Strangler: Finally, away from that guy.
SpongeBob: [on the airplane a row behind Strangler] Good idea, bodyguard. They’ll never find us up here. [Strangler jumps out of the plane screaming, he opens his parachute, but it is actually SpongeBob] Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane. [Strangler takes out a giant pair of scissors and cuts the strings off the SpongeBob parachute and plummets right into the Bikini Bottom Police Station jail. SpongeBob comes running up to him] Bodyguard, bodyguard!
Strangler: Look, kid... I'm not your bodyguard! [cries] I'm the Strangler! See?! [looks toward his 'WANTED' poster on the wall]
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Strangler! [police officers walk up]
Officer Nancy: Good work, SpongeBob. You put the Strangler behind bars.
Strangler: At least I'm safe from that yellow idiot.
Patrick: Hey, Mac, [Strangler turns and sees Patrick in the cell with him] what're you in for?
SpongeBob: [putting the meat on the patty] Easy... [takes all the condiments and throws them in the air. They all land nicely stacked on top of the patty] Perfection!
Squidward: Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now. [sniffles, starts to tear] You grew up so fast, I... [Squidward looks bored] Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this. [gives the order to Squidward] Just take it Squidward, take it away. [cries]
Squidward: Oh, brother. [into microphone] Number 5. Number 5!
SpongeBob: [shows a slip with the number 5 on it] That's me! [takes Krabby Patty and eats it] Mmm. My compliments to the chef! [laughs himself into the kitchen, where he notices something] Hello, what's this? [gets close to the window of the door where his eyes and Mr. Krabs' eyes meet]
Mr. Krabs: Come out here, boy.
SpongeBob: [walks outside] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob and drags him under the dumpster] Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole.
SpongeBob: [whispering] What's a hidey-hole?
Mr. Krabs: It's where I hide me treasure. [pushes the dumpster aside and throws SpongeBob out of the hole] Catch! [throws a treasure chest at SpongeBob] Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!
SpongeBob: What's in this thing? Treasure?
Mr. Krabs: A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy.
SpongeBob: Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform. [opens chest]
SpongeBob: Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! [takes out a tattoo] It's me first tattoo.
SpongeBob: Neat.
Mr. Krabs: And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'. [shows a trophy with an arm at the top]
SpongeBob: How'd you win that?
Mr. Krabs: By being the toughest of the tough!
SpongeBob: Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys? [pointing to a picture with 5 sailors in it]
Mr. Krabs: Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's "'Ol Iron Eye", [shows guy with iron for an eye], and "Mutton Chop", [shows guy holding a wrench], me, [shows Mr. Krabs in a navy suit], "Torpedo Belly", [shows big guy with torpedo in his belly], and "Lockjaw Jones". [shows guy with a big jaw &amp; leaning on an anchor]
SpongeBob: Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Of course! I was called "Armor Abs Krabs".
SpongeBob: You were?
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: Well, I guess you were thinner back then.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, really? [takes his navy suit] This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds. [rips navy suit while trying to put it on] Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch.
SpongeBob: You want me to punch you in the stomach?
Mr. Krabs: Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!
SpongeBob: [punches Mr Krabs in the abs, but his arm breaks into little pieces] wow, my entire arm disintegrated.
Mr. Krabs: I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir! [opens kitchen door] Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around! [point to potatoes] To battle stations. [pouring fries into the grease fryer] All hands on deck! [puts 10 Krabby Patties on the grill] Set course for full flavor. [turns knob on stove to the right] Ketchup and mustard off the port bow. [stepping on ketchup and mustard containers] One Krabby Patty ready to set sail. [holding krabby patty up]
Mr. Krabs: No! [SpongeBob drops his Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs. [knocks once on Mr. Krabs door and it opens] Hello? Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs is shown head down on his desk] You alright? Are you sleepy? [pokes Mr. Krabs body knocking it to the floor, revealing an empty shell] Mr. Krabs! [sniffs his arm] I don't smell his pulse. [in the background, a fleshy and pink Mr. Krabs rushes past SpongeBob] What's that? [figure is behind a barrel] Is somebody there?
Mr. Krabs: Don't look at me! Leave me be!
SpongeBob: [throws barrel away] You're alive! And naked...
Mr. Krabs: [crying] It's true. I've molted.
SpongeBob: What's molted?
Mr. Krabs: It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!
SpongeBob: Wow.
Mr. Krabs: 'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab! [sobs]
SpongeBob: Barnacles!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Who cares how silly, pink &amp; fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp &amp; soft you are. How... [Mr. Krabs cries] ...oops.
Mr. Krabs: I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good... [kicks shell into the wall which ricochets back at SpongeBob. He screams. The shell lands on his hand and he runs around, screaming. Then he falls over and goes in his shell]
SpongeBob: Wow, it sure is dark in here. [pokes head through the shell] Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're a genius.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not about what's on the outside. It's what's on the in...
Mr. Krabs: No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me.
SpongeBob: I get to be a navy buddy?
Mr. Krabs: Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality.
SpongeBob: Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, show me what you got.
SpongeBob: [pulls nose out to look like Mr. Krabs' then imitates his voice] Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.
Mr. Krabs: Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad.
SpongeBob: I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.
Mr. Krabs: That's me. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story. [pulls covers over the wallet] Goodnight, wallety. [kisses the wallet]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, okay, I get the point.
SpongeBob: Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That'll do, SpongeBob.
[At the reunion]
SpongeBob: Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them! [at the reunion, a tough man is shown lifting Nancy on a treasure chest]
Mr. Krabs: [hiding in a coral plant] No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I won't let you down, sir.
Mutton Chop: Armor Abs Krabs. Come join your navy buddies in a toast.
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Coming! [runs over to the table]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what have I done?
SpongeBob: Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here.
Mr. Krabs: I've created a monster.
Lockjaw Jones: Here's some grog. You still like pineapple, right?
SpongeBob: Like pineapple? I live in one. [everyone laughs]
Torpedo Belly: That Ol' Krabs is manly as ever.
Mr. Krabs: I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off.
Mutton Chop: Hey, Armor Abs, Ol' Iron Eye here has been itching to punch your legendary gut.
SpongeBob: Well, if you think you're man enough.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh, this could be bad.
SpongeBob: Fire the torpedoes. [Iron Eye punches SpongeBob. He bounces around in the shell then comes up dizzy]
Mutton Chop: What do you say, Krabs? Just like old times. [SpongeBob spits out a tooth]
Lockjaw Jones: A tooth.
[SpongeBob spits out two more teeth]
Torpedo Belly: Teeth. Now, that's manly.
[SpongeBob coughs out his skeleton and everyone gasps then cheers]
Mr. Krabs: He did it.
Captain: Alright, me swabbys, it's time to award the trophy of manly toughness. To a man who's toughness has stewed the test of time. And that man is: Eugene Armor Abs Krabs! Come up here , Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself.
Naval Buddies: Armor Abs! Armor Abs! Armor Abs!
SpongeBob: Thanks for the trophy, everybody. [laughs]
Naval Buddies: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
SpongeBob: I...uhh...
Mr. Krabs: Say something.
SpongeBob: Let me spin you a manly yarn.
Mr. Krabs: 'Atta boy.
SpongeBob: So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields.
Mr. Krabs: I'm doomed.
SpongeBob: Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble...
Mutton Chop: Did he say Jellyfish Fields?
Iron Eye: Blowing bubbles?
Mutton Chop: Uhh, what were you doing in Jellyfish Fields?
SpongeBob: Why, jellyfishing, of course.
Naval Buddies: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Phone call for Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob is confused] [quietly yelling] Get off the stage.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, I gotta go. Uhh, thanks. [runs off the stage]
Torpedo Belly: Where do you think you're going? Everybody knows there's two things Ol' Armor Abs Krabs would never do.
Mr. Krabs: Oh no.
Lockjaw Jones: Number one, is spend a penny.
Torpedo Belly: And the other one, is leave without giving Ol' Torpedo Belly one of your world famous steely belly butts. Haha
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean, [Mr. Krabs' voice] arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all.
Mr. Krabs: I can't watch. [SpongeBob &amp; Torpedo Belly butt each other in the belly and sends SpongeBob flying]
Torpedo Belly: Armor Abs? [SpongeBob flies into a sign and then back into Torpedo Belly breaking the shell. SpongeBob is revealed and everyone gets angry]
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville, boys, uhh, men.
Mr. Krabs: No! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am. [everyone gasps] Alright, lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable. [cries] But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: None taken, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, lad, let's go home.
Mutton Chop: Wait a minute! You've forgotten something. [hands trophy to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand.
Mutton Chop: Admitting you lost your shell is the toughest thing I've ever seen. And, uhh, I have a confession. [rips off sideburns] These are fake! [SpongeBob &amp; Mr. Krabs gasp]
Torpedo Belly: Over here.
Mr. Krabs: You, too, Torpedo Belly?
Torpedo Belly: Actually, I had my torpedo removed long ago.
Lockjaw Jones: And these aren't the same choppers that I had in the navy.
Iron Eye: My iron eye is actually made of Formica. [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back. [both laugh]
Flying Dutchman: [Green fog passes by his ship while he steers his ship] Curse this cursed, ghostly fog. I can barely see past me own nose. [gas is sprayed in his eyes] Urrgh! [Screams after noticing the unseen cliff, only seen seconds after] [then the ship is split in half after it runs into a cliff. The Flying Dutchman falls down the cliff] Arrgh! [Continues falling, falling through a basketball hoop before hitting the ground. The ship falls onto of him into pieces then he crawls out] Me ship. [his ship turns into dust. His hat floats gently down, and he picks it up. He then gets out his cell phone to dial  the Roadside Assistance] Hello, Roadside Assistance? I've got a bit of a flat! My location where I'll be staying? Business or residence? [sees SpongeBob go into his house] Residence. [SpongeBob is walking through his house as The Flying Dutchman comes up and scares him through the floor] Argh!
SpongeBob: The Flying Dutchman! [melts into a puddle inside his pants] What are you doing in my house?
Flying Dutchman: I'm stuck here while my ship is being repaired. Until then, I'm here to haunt ya! [laughs maniacally, and ghostly snake "tongues" come out with evil grins. SpongeBob screams and runs to Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! [knocks on the door] Squidward! Help! [Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob continues to knock but on Squidward's face]
Squidward: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ee! Ow! Ee! Ooh!
SpongeBob: Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh, a ghost in my house!
Squidward: [muffled and grabs SpongeBob's arm] SpongeBob, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't believe in ghosts and I never liked you! [closes door]
SpongeBob: PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! [Patrick opens up his rock] Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch... [Patrick closes his rock] ...man. [Gary meows loudly] Gary! [opens his door and gasps] Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!
Flying Dutchman: Aw, I just wanted to pet the little guy. [SpongeBob shows teary eyes, then snaps out of it. Gary looks relaxed] There, there. Dutchie's not gonna hurt ya. I love me a good snail. [SpongeBob smiles sheepishly, the Flying Dutchman eats Gary.]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob screams and rips off the sides of his head]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob looks down] Meow!
SpongeBob: [relieved and happy] Gary!
Flying Dutchman: [cackles] Nothing better than giving a good scare! Argh! [laughs]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Gary. [fire surrounds the Flying Dutchman and SpongeBob]
Flying Dutchman: [Talking scarily...] Don't get too comfortable! [cut to SpongeBob walking up to his house, which is set on fire, making it look like a monster house. His house makes an evil laugh. SpongeBob does not get scared, but he looks like he's upset. Cut to SpongeBob's bedtime]
SpongeBob: Goodnight, Gary. [They both sleep. Suddenly, his nose starts to itch so a yellow tentacle scratches it. SpongeBob pulls off his blanket to reveal him as an octopus. He screams while the Flying Dutchman laughs. Cut to SpongeBob opening up the refrigerator to a monster popping out and scaring him. Both laugh. Cut to SpongeBob looking in the mirror when in the reflection only, a monster eats him. He sighs and walks off. Cut to him eating cereal, which are eyeballs, and they blink. He sighs and walks off again]
Flying Dutchman: Hmm? [SpongeBob walks up and opens a drawer then sighs and takes out the skeleton in it. As he's walking out, a monster pops out from underneath the floor and tries to scare SpongeBob, but it doesn't. The monster turns into a giant cockroach, a baby, a clown, which laughs evilly in SpongeBob's face, then Sherlock Holmes, who smokes a pipe, then he spits it out and screams, and even SpongeBob's head. It then grimaces, and dozens of spiders come out, but still nothing is working. Dutchman's head pops out] Hmm?
SpongeBob: Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer?
Flying Dutchman: Why aren't you freakin' out, lad?
SpongeBob: Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks.
Flying Dutchman: What are you trying to say?
SpongeBob: Eeeh.
Flying Dutchman: I know when I'm washed up. I've been doing the same material for years! Scaring is a young man's game. It's time to give up the ghost; no pun intended.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all.
Flying Dutchman: Don't lie to me!
SpongeBob: You just gotta scare someone other than me.
Flying Dutchman: Hmm... [scene cuts to the Bikini Bottom Mattress Discount]
Fish: Mind if I test it out? [hops onto the mattress] Yeah, this does feel comfortable. [doorbell rings]
Mattress Salesman: Would you excuse me for a moment? [The fish on the mattress falls asleep as the Flying Dutchman tries to scare him. First he scares normally, then scares by opening his mouth to reveal a skeleton. Nothing is working]
Flying Dutchman: Grr! [Shakes the guy continuously] Raargh! Raargh! Move! Raargh! [Puts the guy back to his mattress] Ah, forget it. [Mattress Salesman comes back]
Mattress Salesman: So, what do you think? [the sleeping fish screams. Scene cuts to The Flying Dutchman trying to scare a little girl jumping rope. The jump rope hits him back]
Flying Dutchman: It's official; I'm not scary anymore.
SpongeBob: Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.
Flying Dutchman: Maybe I just need a break. Take some time off, you know?
SpongeBob: Sure, relax a little.
Flying Dutchman: Maybe stay with a friend for a while. On a comfy couch in a pineapple. Just for a little while longer? 'Til I get back on my feet?
Narrator: 6 Months Later...
SpongeBob: [walks into his house] Hey, champ! How's it... [screams]
Red Ghost: Turn it up...
Purple Ghost: Turn the knob up.
Yellow Ghost: Whoo!
Flying Dutchman: Who'd guess we have so much in common? You like teddy bears; I like teddy bears. You like ponies; I like ponies!
Nancy: Is that a wedding ring?
Flying Dutchman: Oh, this? Oh, it's nothing. [takes it off and throws it away, landing on SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: What is going on around here?
Flying Dutchman: Come on, SpongeBob, don't be a stick in the mud!
Purple Ghost: Look out below! [riding on a motorcycle down the stairs and crashing into SpongeBob's wall] How was that?
Flying Dutchman: Even better the third time.
SpongeBob: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Everyone, get out!
Flying Dutchman: Alrighty, boys, party's over. [to Nancy] Time to scoot, honey. [everyone leaves, except SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman]
SpongeBob: Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?
Flying Dutchman: Well, it is comfy.
SpongeBob: Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!
Flying Dutchman: Ah, you're right, SpongeBob. I'm pathetic.
SpongeBob: Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now. [SpongeBob puts a tape into the VCR]
Flying Dutchman: What in barnacles is it?
SpongeBob: A journey into self-awareness. [on the tape is a fish that uses a square hammer on a gong. An eagle flies through some mountains and calls out. Then some fish, wearing robes and roller skating, skate in a straight line]
Fish: The power within. The power within. [last fish holds a medallion up]
Fish #2: [whispering] The power within. The power within. The power within. The power within. [the man multiples into a blue, red, and green being of himself] The power within. The power within. [picks up some dirt] The power within! Yeah.
Flying Dutchman: That was beautiful!
SpongeBob: Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious. [cut to later that night where an elderly fish lady is walking by some seaweed, where SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman are hiding behind] Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?
Flying Dutchman: What are you kidding me? Scaring her is too easy.
SpongeBob: Now that's the Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action.
Flying Dutchman: No problemo, compadre. [thunder claps while the Dutchman screams at the old lady] Yargh!
Old Lady: Lonnie is that you?
Flying Dutchman: What? No! 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman! [screams]
Old Lady: Lonnie, there's this great new product called toothpaste. I think you should try it. [cut to SpongeBob flying on the Flying Dutchman's back. They spot a gym]
Flying Dutchman: Let's hit it. [The Flying Dutchman, goes through the wall, but SpongeBob does not, smashing into the wall. Inside, Larry the Lobster is lifting weights. Then he looks into the mirror]
Larry: Dude, look at your pecks! You're phenomenal! Truly a hard body. Look at those guns. [Flying Dutchman attempts to scare him. Larry gasps]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Now he's got him.
Larry: My latissimus dorsi has gone flabby! I gotta get to a rolling machine. [leaves]
Flying Dutchman: Ah. It's no use, SpongeBob. I can't seem to scare anyone. Maybe people just don't believe in ghosts anymore.
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems! [whispers into the Flying Dutchman's ears] ...goblins...guilt trip... [scene cuts to Squidward's house where Squidward slips into his bunny slippers and walks to the mirror. When he picks up his powder, it floats by itself and applies itself onto Squidward.]
Squidward: Huh? [Green fog begins to appear and a voice is heard in the fog]
Mrs. Tentacles: Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What's going on?
Mrs. Tentacles: Why haven't you called me?
Squidward: Mother?
Mrs. Tentacles: Why haven't you called your mother?
Squidward: [screams] Uh, Squiddums loves his mama.
Mrs. Tentacles: Why don't you call me then? Why don't you call me? Why don't you call me? [her face melts turning into a clarinet that plays music. The clarinet goes into one of Squidward's ears and out the other, literally]
Flying Dutchman: [through the clarinet] I heard you don't believe in ghosts!
Squidward: Ghosts?
Flying Dutchman: As in the Flying Dutchman! [tosses Squidward against the wall]
Squidward: There's no such thing as ghosts. No such thing.
Flying Dutchman: No such thing as ghosts? No such thing as ghosts?! You don't believe in ghosts?! [floor turns into liquid. Another ghost pops up and eats Squidward sending him into a light that spits him back into his house. A giant SpongeBob is sitting there breathing in and out really hard]
Squidward: SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's eyes twist around his head and spiders crawl out and reveal the Flying Dutchman. Flying Dutchman does a trick to think that he is pulling his finger off]
Flying Dutchman: Ooh, scary!
Squidward: No! No! That's impossible! [runs out of his house] Ghosts! Ghosts!
SpongeBob: [runs out of the closet] Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!
Flying Dutchman: And me confidence, too. Now I feel like I can scare the living criminy out of anybody! All thanks to you, my boy.
SpongeBob: And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.
Flying Dutchman: Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya. [flies back up to his ship] Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls. [ships sails off. SpongeBob opens the package. A hand grabs him and pulls him in. SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Good Ol' Dutchie!
SpongeBob: [squeezes some shell wax onto Gary's shell] All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob grabs his nose and uses his back to wax Gary's shell]
SpongeBob: Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood. [opens Gary's shell and jumps in] Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Still? From New Year's Eve? [Gary blows his horn. SpongeBob sees something in his shell] What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary. [laughs] My favorite novelty t-shirt! [holds up a shirt that says I &lt;3 Krabby Patties. Doorbell rings] Oh, someone's here. [jumps out of Gary's shell]
Mailman: Special delivery for SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special? [hugs the mailman]
Mailman: Alright, do we have to go through this every time I give you your mail? Sheesh. [leaves]
SpongeBob: What could it be today, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [opens package] A videotape? [reads it] "You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants! [inserts videotape into VCR. Videotape plays]
Announcer: Karate Island: A serene and exotic location where nature and beauty abound, and hundreds of fighting styles collide in a wave of non-stop, pulsating, no-hold barred action! For centuries, the world's top karate artists have journeyed to this land to be crowned King of Karate.
SpongeBob: King of Karate?
Announcer: Now it's your turn...
Announcer 2: ...SpongeBob SquarePants.
Announcer: You've won an all-expense paid trip to Karate Island! Hi-yah! Where you'll be crowned this year's King of Karate!
SpongeBob: Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned... [shouts karate yells] King of Karate! [jumps to the door, leaving his arm in the ground] Whoo-hoo! [shouts karate yells]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.
Sandy: Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.
Sandy: But, my karate is better than yours by a country mile, and I've never been invited.
SpongeBob: Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.
Sandy: There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up.
SpongeBob: All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment. [laughs. Scene cuts to both in a boat heading towards Karate Island] Are we there yet?
Sandy: Yup. That's it over there.
SpongeBob: What make you think that's Karate Island? [big sign that says "Welcome to Karate Island" is pointing at the island]
Sandy: I don't know -- lucky guess? [three fish are waiting on top of some rocks for SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Sandy arrive on the island]
SpongeBob: Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.
Fish: Welcome to my island, SpongeBob-san. [bows]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you. [bows]
Master Udon: I am Master Udon.
Sandy: Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself.
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.
Sandy: Oh, brother.
Master Udon: Please, show me some of your moves, Master SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You hear that, Sandy? He called me "master." Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em. [three fighters appear]
Sandy: SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders.
SpongeBob: Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister. [shouts karate yells at the first fighter. He falls to the ground] Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?
Sandy: Something smells like rancid rodeo around here. [all the fighters are knocked out]
Master Udon: Excellent. Truly, you are King of Karate.
SpongeBob: The one and only.
Master Udon: We must make ready for your coronation.
SpongeBob: I'm ready to be King of Karate! [gong sounds]
Master Udon: King of Karate-san, it is time for you to take your rightful place on your throne.
SpongeBob: My throne. [floats over to the throne]
Sandy: All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This place is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder.
SpongeBob: [sitting on his throne] Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement. [claps twice] Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend. [chair is brought]
Sandy: SpongeBob, y'all are getting a bit wily.
SpongeBob: Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?
Sandy: Heck, I could karate you into a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back.
SpongeBob: [laughs] But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.
Sandy: I'm getting off this crazy train! [mumbles]
Master Udon: Master, don't worry about her. She is missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. [laughs] Let the coronation begin!
SpongeBob: Sandy's going to miss out, big time. [suddenly SpongeBob is chained down to the throne. Master Udon reaches into his robe and takes out a pen]
Sandy: That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting -- and that ain't much.
SpongeBob: No!
Sandy: SpongeBob's in trouble! [SpongeBob screams] SpongeBob is the "King of Karate". He doesn't need me. Eh, he can handle this himself.
SpongeBob: [in the distance] Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.
Sandy: Hold on, buddy! [enters a building where Master Udon is watching from above]
SpongeBob: No, Sandy!
Master Udon: She will never reach you. She must first pass through the 'Four Floors of Fear'.
Sandy: [enters first room] SpongeBob?
The Tickler: Ha. Ha-ha-ha. You cannot pass unless you defeat me, The Tickler, and my iron-finger style. [both get ready then attack] Ha-ha. Look!
Sandy: Huh? [laughs as she is being tickled]
The Tickler: Prepare for the tickling of your life!
Sandy: Taste these! [has a plate full of jelly-filled donuts]
The Tickler: Oh no! Jelly-filled donuts? How did you know they were my weakness?
Sandy: No one can resist jelly-filled. [throws the donuts into The Tickler's mouth] Sticky around, I'll be back with the glazed.
The Tickler: I could use a wet napkin.
Sandy: [enters floor two] All right, who's next?
Lip Service: Halt! No one advances past me, Lip Service, and my power-flexi dynamo-lip thruster style. [attacks Sandy]
Lip Service: Dance, squirrel, dance. [her lips send Sandy backwards]
Sandy: Advanced hair-dryer style!
Lip Service: [laughs] What do you expect to do with that? [Sandy uses the hair-dryer to blow air on Lip Service’s lips, making them chapped] Oh, no! Not chapped lips! [takes out some lip balm. Applies some, but it breaks her lips]
Sandy: That's enough lip out of you. [enters third floor, but slips on her way in, because it's covered in mud. She slides into a big green Jabba The Hutt look-alike]
Filthy Phil: No one has ever made it to the lair of Filthy Phil. No one passes except me. Now, feel the steam of my horrible body odor. [strains to get body odor out. The body odor tries to get into Sandy's helmet, but can't]
Sandy: Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome.
Filthy Phil: Fresh-air dome? [inhales his own body odor] Man, I really do stink. [passes out. Sandy breaks through some boards to enter floor four where Master Udon is]
Master Udon: You are one impressive squirrel. You even made a costume change.
Sandy: Release SpongeBob!
Master Udon: Never. [as Sandy is going to attack, she is trapped in a bird cage. She strains to break through, but she can't] He is forbidden to leave until...he signs this contract.
Sandy: What are you talking about?
Master Udon: Real estate.
Sandy: You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?
Master Udon: Yes. If there was a real Karate Island, I'd be a millionaire.
SpongeBob: You mean I'm not King of Karate?
Master Udon: No. But you could be King of Condos. Here, let me explain. It's really quite simple. [pulls down chart] See, if you invest in a time share here on Condo Island, you can see your equity increase ten-fold. Perhaps you and your yellow friend would like to set up a timeshare plan?
SpongeBob: Don't do it, Sandy! [Sandy chants something]
Sandy: [breaks the bird cage] I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!
Master Udon: Then give into my fists. [rips off robe and exposes his speedo and to show a more buff Master Udon. Sandy does the same by ripping off her jumpsuit then exposing her bikini to reveal a buff Sandy. Both flex their bodies, starting with the extra muscles like Sandy’s Tail along with Master Udon’s Eyebrows next The Chests,Arms,Legs and they both do primal roars,then fight.They miss each other from Charging.Master Udon turns back to get her. Sandy jumps on top of Master Udon's head, then slaps him with her feet. Master Udon then grabs Sandy by her ankles then spins her around and throws her into the wall. Sandy retaliates by springing of the wall and landing in front of Master Udon They karate chop some more before Sandy grabs him and throws him on the ground over and over. She then throws him in the air and kicks him in the face, sending him outside of the tower and falling into the ocean]
Sandy: You're in the soup now, Udon! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy walking toward their boat]
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from... [swallows hard] buying a condo.
Sandy: Aw, shucks, SpongeBob, that's what friends are for.
SpongeBob: I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?
Sandy: You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location... [boat drives off as another boat, carrying Squidward, arrives]
Squidward: I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived! [Master Udon is waiting on top of the rocks again]
[scene cuts to black, then fades to dedication of Pat Morita (1932 - 2005)]
Customer: 1 monster Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: Hmph, no one's ordered the monster Patty in ages. SpongeBob, 1 monster Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [gasps, shaking] Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!
Squidward: Uh, 1 monster Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!
Customers: Monster Krabby Patty?!
Customer #2: [in bathroom] Monster Krabby Patty?!
[A set of real hands drops a huge meat pile on the grill]
SpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune.
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: [puts his spatula under the meat] We can do this. At the count of 3, we flip. Ready? 1, 2, 3. [Attempts to flip; spatula breaks in half] Spat?
[SpongeBob screams and cries in front of everyone while showing his spatula that is brokenunfixed. The scene cuts to SpongeBob to a therapist]
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go on. [SpongeBob cries once more.]
[SpongeBob is on a cliff, still crying. Patrick comes up and joins in crying. Switches to an ambulance taking Spatula away, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob quietly watch]
Mr. Krabs: Well, we better get back to work.
SpongeBob: Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!
Mr. Krabs: Use another spatula'r.
SpongeBob: [close-up of his face, his eyes are hypno-like] WHAT?! There is only 1 spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat! [runs off to the hospital] I'm coming, Spat!
[scene cuts to the hospital where SpongeBob is by a spatula's bed]
SpongeBob: Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.
[SpongeBob flashes back to all the good times he had with his spatula: flipping patties, laying in the sun with spatula, scratching his back with spatula, playing ping pong with his spatula, reaching under the chair for the remote with spatula, and playing pirates with spatula]
Doctor: There’s no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.
[SpongeBob turns around and starts to cry, then turns back around]
Doctor: Go home. Get some rest. We’ll try to do everything we can.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor who’s searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part. [gives a sigh of relief]
SpongeBob: [gives a kiss to the spatula and walks out of the hospital] Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that! [notices a sign that says "LE SPATULA INSIDE" and a picture of a high-tech spatula is on it]
SpongeBob: [Thinks] Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this. [walks off then reappears inside the shop in front of the spatula. Thinks] Maybe I do need this. [his eyes are shaped as a spatula]
Doctor: [in SpongeBob's thought bubble] I would give serious consideration to... [bell gongs] a replacement spatula.
[SpongeBob slowly reaches for the spatula, but his hand is slapped away by 1 of the employees]
SpongeBob: OW!
Employee: Uh-uh! No touchy-touchy the Le Spatula! It is very, very expensive.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry.
Employee: Of course, if you purchase this fine item, you may... hold it.
SpongeBob: I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it? [takes out a bunch of money]
Employee: Umm... [takes out a calculator and punches in many numbers] ...no.
[Scene switches to SpongeBob's house, next to a shelf of piggy banks]
SpongeBob: [breaks a piggy bank with a hammer] How about now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob: [breaks another piggy bank] Now?
Employee: No.
[Repeat SpongeBob's action and the above two lines for three more piggy banks]
SpongeBob: [lifts up Gary's shell where there is a big diamond under it] Now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob: [sells his house] That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?
Employee: Everything, huh? [Looks at SpongeBob clothes] Nice outfit.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street nude where everyone is looking at him in shock]
SpongeBob: Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking? [walks into the Krusty Krab, passes Squidward] Ooh, breezy today.
Squidward: [Snickers] Nice outfit, SpongeBob! [laughs hysterically]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.
Mr. Krabs: What’s all the lallygagging about?
Squidward: [still laughing] Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: This better be good. [walks into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Soon, everyone will know of your beauty.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, what's going on in [sees SpongeBob naked] ...ooh... Don't you have any shame, boy?
SpongeBob: All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs. [shows Le Spatula]
Mr. Krabs: Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?
SpongeBob: Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma. [Le Spatula glows]
Mr. Krabs: Well, what can it do?
Squidward: Can it make me famous?
SpongeBob: Anything you want and more. [pushes a button and the spatula spins]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, that sounds exciting. Let me have a go at it. [Reaches for Le Spatula]
SpongeBob: [Holds Le Spatula away from Mr. Krabs' reach] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] What? Are you going against your commanding officer?
SpongeBob: No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.
Mr. Krabs: With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... [pushes a button and a bunch of spatulas appear]
Le Spatula: [says mechanically] Le Spatula 3000 at your service!
Mr. Krabs: Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket. [laughs and walks away with Squidward]
SpongeBob: Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy? [all the spatulas go into hiding] Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job. [scene cuts to outside the kitchen]
Martin: Uh, can I get 1 Krabby Patty, please?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need 1 Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [back in the kitchen] 1 Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split. [tries to use Le Spatula, but every time he tries to flip the patty, the spatula goes another direction] Spat, is there something wrong, pal?
Le Spatula: I would not dare touch such slop as this, how you say, Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!
SpongeBob: But, but, I thought we were friends.
Le Spatula: Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class. [jumps out of SpongeBob's arms and extends it legs to land on the floor] Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook! [runs out laughing]
SpongeBob: Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something. [Le Spatula punches SpongeBob in the face]
Le Spatula: How’s that for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon. [spits and runs out]
Mr. Krabs: What happened?
SpongeBob: Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.
Mr Krabs: Well, how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULAR?!
SpongeBob: I had a spatula once. A real spatula. 1 that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!
Mr. Krabs: I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.
Mr. Krabs: Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers. [starts to cry; scene cuts to the spatula's hospital bed from the start of the episode, with the pulse meter slowing, then becomes a flat line]
SpongeBob: Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late! [cries]
Doctor: SpongeBob, I hate to tell you this...
SpongeBob: I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone! [sobs]
Doctor: Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm so sorry. [cries more]
Doctor: Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary. [scene pans over to the Infirmary where Spat is in a wheelchair]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Spatula! [runs into the infirmary] Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better! [Spat turns around and ignores SpongeBob] Spatula, what's wrong? [spatula shakes its head] But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?! [begins burst into tears loudly and rolls. As he is doing this, another SpongeBob comes up into the scene]
SpongeBob: [in a monotone voice]&#160;: All that glitters is not gold. [as SpongeBob is still crying loudly, spatula wheels itself away]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, best friend!
[SpongeBob crawls crying all the way to the Krusty Krab kitchen]
SpongeBob: I'll never find another spatula like him again. [notices a spatula flipping patties by itself] Spatula? You're back! [SpongeBob jumps for spatula in slow motion, camera cuts to outer space] Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.
Squidward: 1 monster Krabby Patty. [the same real set of hands put a bunch of meat on the grill as before]
SpongeBob: Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? 1, 2, 3. [SpongeBob's arms come off] D'oh! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [walks up to a pay phone to check if there is any money in it, but there is none] Nothing. Oh well. [hears something in the distance] That sounds like a quarter crying for help. [a quarter rolls in front of Mr. Krabs] Come to papa!
Martha Smith: Hold it right there, buddy! My son just dropped that quarter.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah? Well that kid looks pretty shifty to me. How do I know he didn't steal it? [Martha hits Mr. Krabs in the face with her purse] Hey! That little brat is throwing perfectly good money away! Oh, so if I can't have it, no one... [gets hit in the face with the purse again] I hope he throws all your retirement money down a hole! [walks over to the well] Poor little quarter. What the...? This well is full of money! Don't worry little fellas, I'll save you! [tries to climb in the well but is too big] Oh, it's no use. Me poop deck's too big.
Gale: Make a wish, dear.
Harold: All my wishes have already come true.
Gale: Oh you. [tosses the coin at the well]
Mr. Krabs: No! [jumps at the coin] I'll save ya, money! [grabs the coin] Gotcha. What do you heartless brutes think you're doing?
Harold: Umm, using the wishing well.
Gale: You toss in a coin and make a wish.
Mr. Krabs: And then what?
Harold: And... that's it. Nothing else happens.
Gale: It's fun!
Mr. Krabs: You mean suckers throw in money down a hole for fun? That's the greatest scam ever.
Harold: Can we have our quarter back now? [scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
Squidward: SpongeBob, why aren't those patties ready?
SpongeBob: You can't rush perfection.
Squidward: I'm not rushing perfection. I'm rushing you.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Always the kidder, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, this job stinks! But at least I'm not digging ditches.
Mr. Krabs: [enters the Krusty Krab] Squidward, SpongeBob, I got a new job for ya. [scene cuts to outside Krusty Krab where there is a red X on the ground] X marks the spot of the Eugene Krabs Memorial Wishing Well.
SpongeBob: A wishing well, here? Wow!
Squidward: Don't you have to be dead to have a memorial anything?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, don't you believe in magic? [walks off]
SpongeBob: Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?
Squidward: No, I don't, and neither does Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true. [starts digging] What's the first thing you're gonna wish for?
Squidward: To be far away from you as possible. C'mon, SpongeBob, this hole's not gonna dig itself. And I'm certainly not gonna do it.
SpongeBob: Squidward, aren't you excited? This is really gonna help people. ♪Take a penny and some magic, even though your life is tragic...♪
Squidward: Hey!
SpongeBob: ♪...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you'll ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well. When your life's come apart at the seams that you've given up all your dreams, here is just the means to make those dreams come true. No more suffering, no more sighin', no more pain and no more cryin'.♪
Squidward: I'm not cryin'! [SpongeBob hits him with the wand] Ow. Ow.
SpongeBob: ♪When you throw all your dreams down the well.♪ [puts an "open" sign in front of the well] Well, Squidward, what do you think?
Squidward: That was the worst song I ever heard. But at least this stupid well's finished.
Mr. Krabs: It's beautiful. [takes a whiff of the air] You smell that, boys? That's the smell of money.
SpongeBob: You mean magic, don't ya?
Squidward: All I can smell is that dumpster. [scene pans over to a dumpster behind Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: All right, Squidward, you can go back to the register.
Squidward: As long as there's no singing.
SpongeBob: And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, SpongeBob. Let me show you your new station. It's kind of a promotion. Sorta.
SpongeBob: A promotion? [scene cuts to SpongeBob being lowered in the well by a bucket] Why do I have to go down in the well?
Mr. Krabs: To collect the money!
SpongeBob: How long do I have to stay down here?
Mr. Krabs: See ya in 8 hours.
SpongeBob: Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here. [a coin hits SpongeBob in the head]
Sandy: I sure wish I had a fancy telescope. One that works underwater. That'd make me happier than a junebug at a porch light sale.
SpongeBob: Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes... [another coin hits SpongeBob in the head]
Plankton: I have presented you with a monetary offering as custom dictates. My wish, née my command, is to be taller. Just a little? Just big enough to crush my enemies, like the vermin they are!
SpongeBob: Gosh... [another coin hits SpongeBob in the head] Ow!
Mrs. Puff: I wish I had a snazzy new boat. I wanna be a hot rod momma. [SpongeBob gasps. Patrick walks up to the well drinking a soda and throws it down the well when he is finished]
SpongeBob: Hey!
Patrick: Oh my gosh. Who said that?
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: How do you know my name?
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish.
Patrick: Okay, magical talking trashcan. [takes out a coin from his pocket] I wish SpongeBob were here to see this. [throws himself and the coin down the well]
SpongeBob: Patrick.
Patrick: [lands on top of SpongeBob] Hi, SpongeBob! I got my wish.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it.
Patrick: But I got my wish.
SpongeBob: Well, we've got 6½ hours ‘til the end of my shift. What do you want to do now?
Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] Tag, you're it.
Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] Tag, you're it. [day turns into night]
Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] Tag, you're it.
Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] Tag, you're it.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what kind of haul did you get?
SpongeBob: I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton... [Patrick smiles big] ...and a slightly used pair of dentures.
Patrick: And I fell on my head.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I could probably get a couple of bucks for Patrick. Nah. You better just hand up the money. [sends the bucket down]
SpongeBob: This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah sure, whatever.
SpongeBob: Can we come out now?
Mr. Krabs: Goodness no. You gotta stay down there just in case any late-night wishers come by. I'll be back for ya at dawn. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic?
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: ♪Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble, so Patrick grab a shovel, and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.♪ [digs a hole and something yellow glows from the hole] Holy mackerel, look Patrick! We've struck magic.
Patrick: Is that good?
SpongeBob: Next to being the fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done.
Patrick: It's the only thing I've ever done.
Squidward: Having fun down there, SpongeBob? [laughs]
Patrick: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better.
SpongeBob: Do you wanna make a wish?
Squidward: [laughs] I got my wish. You two are stuck in a dark hole and away from me.
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic.
Squidward: [laughs] There's no magic, SpongeBob. Wishing wells are just a scam to fool saps like you. [laughs]
SpongeBob: No it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it. [Squidward laughs so hard he falls down the well landing on SpongeBob and Patrick] Squidward! You decided to join the party.
Patrick: Party!
Squidward: Let me out of here.
SpongeBob: We were just gonna play some party games.
Patrick: [pokes Squidward] Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob: [pokes Squidward] Tag, you're it.
Patrick: [pokes Squidward] Tag, you're it.
Squidward: I gotta get out of here. [tries to climb out of the well]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Go Squidward! Go Squidward! [he falls]
Squidward: There's no way to climb out of here.
SpongeBob: Maybe if you had more upper arm strength.
Patrick: Yeah you should work out more.
Squidward: Well why don't I just start right now? After all i got a couple of dumbbells right here. [laughs]
Patrick: I don't get it.
Squidward: Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic.
Patrick: What does claustrophobic mean?
SpongeBob: It means he's afraid of Santa Claus.
Squidward: No it doesn't.
Patrick: Ho, ho, ho! [giggles]
SpongeBob: Stop it Patrick, you're scaring him!
Patrick: Ho, ho, ho!
Squidward: It's not working, Patrick.
Patrick: Darn.
SpongeBob: Umm Squidward you're standing on my foot.
Squidward: Oh, sorry SpongeBob.
Patrick: [holding a plate of ribs] And you got your elbow in my ribs.
Squidward: Eww. Patrick!
Patrick: [shoves Squidward] And stop stepping in my potato salad.
SpongeBob: Hey, hey, hey, guys.
Squidward: [shoves Patrick] Stop pushing me Patrick.
Patrick: You mean like this? [shoves Squidward]
Squidward: No like this! [shoves Patrick]
SpongeBob: [both Patrick and Squidward are fighting] You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place. [scene zooms to outside the well]
Squidward: Patrick, get off of me! [scene zooms back into the well where Patrick is sitting on Squidward] I told you I am claustrophobic!
Patrick: Nice try, Squidward, but there's no Santa Claus here.
Squidward: [yells] Patrick! [scene cuts to daytime where Mr. Krabs returns to the well]
Mr. Krabs: Good morning SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got. [raises the bucket] Oh, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money. [Squidward comes out of the well]
Squidward: Free. I'm free!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward? What were you doing down there? I didn't approve any overtime. Or were you sneaking here in the dead of night for free wishes?
Squidward: The only thing I wish for is to be far away from here. [gets hit by a bus that is traveling to 'very very far away'] Ow.
SpongeBob: Bye Squidward. Enjoy your trip!
Patrick: [pulls a long face] Lucky. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: So how much money did you make last night?
SpongeBob: We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic.
Mr. Krabs: The what?
SpongeBob: We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!
Mr. Krabs: Listen closely, SpongeBob. You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it. [a big telescope with an eye looking out of it appears. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob scream] What in the deep blue is that?
Sandy: There's a full moon out tonight. Do you like my new telescope I wished for?
SpongeBob: That's great, Sandy!
Sandy: That wishing well sure does work.
Mr. Krabs: Just a coincidence. [Mrs. Puff drives up in a new boat]
Mrs. Puff: What do you think of my new hot rod?
SpongeBob: It's beautiful Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin? [both laugh]
Mrs. Puff: No. [drives off]
SpongeBob: See Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat.
Mr. Krabs: You mean she stole that boat.
Plankton: [walks up gigantically tall] Morning SpongeBob. Krabs. Beautiful day. [laughs evilly and runs over to the buildings and knocks them over]
SpongeBob: Is that proof enough for ya?
Mr. Krabs: You'll never get me to believe in magic, never! Just to prove it to ya. [walks over to the well] I'll demonstrate. I wish... I was steamed and served with a side of melted butter. [lets go of the penny and laughs]
SpongeBob: [frantically grabs him] Mr. Krabs! No!
Mr. Krabs: Well, where's your magic now? [suddenly vanishes in thin air, to SpongeBob's surprise. Mr. Krabs appears as a real crab on a plate] Oh where am I? [person puts melted butter next to him] What's going on here? [person sits down and puts on an eating bib that says "THE END" on it] Uh-oh. I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! Oh no! [iris out]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.
SpongeBob: Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
Mr. Krabs: Fine?! [grabs SpongeBob's mouth and ties it up] Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. [cries]
SpongeBob: Time off?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. [runs out]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that went better than expected.
SpongeBob: [running down the street] I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation. [enters his house] Hey, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary. [walks into his bed and closes his eyes for no more than two seconds before his alarm goes off. Scene cuts to him lifting his weights, eating cereal, flossing, showering, then putting on some spray to make him shine. He grabs his hat then walks into the Krusty Krab] Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: I thought you were on vacation.
Mr. Krabs: [stops SpongeBob] He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.
SpongeBob: What's a vacation?
Mr. Krabs: Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.
SpongeBob: [gasps] No work?! But what'll I do all day?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.
SpongeBob: But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
Squidward: Nor will I.
Mr. Krabs: That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
Patrick: [walks in] Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.
Mr. Krabs: Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.
SpongeBob: Replacement?
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: That's enough banter on my dime.
Patrick: Ok, boss.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job. [takes SpongeBob's hat and spatula and gives it to Patrick]
Patrick: Wow. [notices his reflection in the spatula] Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher. [scratches his belly and his back] Wow. It scratches backs, too!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.
SpongeBob: I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. [Mr. Krabs shuts the doors in SpongeBob's face. Scene cuts to inside SpongeBob's house]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work. [stomach growls then shrinks. SpongeBob gasps] My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! [scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.
SpongeBob: I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?
SpongeBob: I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.
SpongeBob: You have my word, sir. No working. [enters kitchen] Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch... [screams as he sees Patrick putting patties, attached to his body, on the grill] Patrick, you can't do that!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit. [turns the knob to the right from 297 to 298. Takes Patrick's spatula] Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [storms into the kitchen] SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
SpongeBob: Wait, it's not what you think.
Mr. Krabs: [wheels SpongeBob on a dolly] Out you go, boy.
SpongeBob: But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, boy... [launches SpongeBob off] off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over. [scene cuts to SpongeBob entering his house]
SpongeBob: Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. [sits down in front of a toy Krusty Krab with Krusty Krew figures. Opens it up]
Squidward: [SpongeBob imitating him] SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
Mr. Krabs: [SpongeBob imitating him] SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over. [takes SpongeBob's Krusty hat off. SpongeBob walks home, sad]
SpongeBob: [walking inside his pineapple] Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. [plays with a smaller Krusty Krab playset]
Squidward: [SpongeBob imitating him] I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where Squidward is washing windows until he sees SpongeBob]
Squidward: Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.
Mr. Krabs: I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up. [SpongeBob steps backwards] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards until he is in front of his house] That'll do.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally. [looks at his net] Hey, that reminds me of... [his net turns into a spatula. Pretends to grill but stops] Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax. [floats onto the ground] That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds. [watches a cloud go by] That one's a jellyfish! [another cloud goes by] That's a pirate ship. [another cloud goes by] And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup? [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where a delivery truck backs up. SpongeBob, in a disguise, walks up to the kitchen door] Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. [another delivery truck backs up. A delivery fish gets out with the same buns on a plate]
Delivery Fish: Huh? What's the big idea, here? [SpongeBob laughs nervously then gets booted out. Scene cuts to the phone ringing inside the Krusty Krab. Patrick answers]
Patrick: Hello? Hello? Hello? [SpongeBob slips through phone cord and through Patrick's head but gets shot out of the Krusty Krab, through the doors. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab restroom where Patrick is cleaning out his ear] Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear. [notices water splashing out from the toilet behind him] Hey, I just cleaned that one.
SpongeBob: Patrick, shhh.
Patrick: It talks! [screams and runs out]
SpongeBob: Somebody help, I'm stuck! [Mr. Krabs walks up] Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here. [Mr. Krabs grabs a cord above the toilet] Um, Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs flushes the toilet] Noooo!! [gets flushed down the toilet. Scene cuts to SpongeBob jumping out of a customers shirt and into the grease fryer in the kitchen] Uh oh.
Mr. Krabs: Now what? [picks up the fryer and sees SpongeBob small and deep fried] Tsk, tsk, tsk. [SpongeBob then crumbles into crumbs and puts him in his boat out back] I've had enough for one day, son. [drives off]
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Not a problem at all, me boy.
SpongeBob: Just take the next right. [Mr. Krabs drives past his house] Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: My house is back that way, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs: Far out, little man. Far out. [drives into a forest and stops]
SpongeBob: Where'd you say you were taking me?
Mr. Krabs: Look, boy, [takes out a spatula] I brought your spatuler. [SpongeBob glares at the spatula and acts like a dog] C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it! [throws the spatula into the forest. SpongeBob chases after it while Mr. Krabs turns around and drives off] Enjoy your vacation, boy!
SpongeBob: It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a... [gasps] ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them! [scene cuts to Patrick running down the street to his rock]
Patrick: Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember. [opens his rock and jumps in] Huh?
SpongeBob: [sitting in the corner of Patrick's rock] Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
Patrick: SpongeBob? Is that you?
SpongeBob: [turns around with an evil look on his face] I've been waiting for you, Patrick! [walks towards Patrick, growling]
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh! [SpongeBob laughs maniacally and closes in around Patrick. Scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
Squidward: What’ll be?
Customer: One Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: One shell on a shingle. [Patrick gives Squidward the order then many orders come out, it blocks the window just for Mr. Krabs to notice]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it. [Patrick turns around, and it turns out to be SpongeBob in a Patrick costume] SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?
SpongeBob: Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. [Patrick is sitting at home watching a broken TV]
Mr. Krabs: Why'd you do it, laddy?
SpongeBob: [starts to cry] Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
Mr. Krabs: You don't have to. [takes out a calendar] Your accumulated vacation time is used up. [tears up calendar] The union can't fine me, anymore.
SpongeBob: You must've saved a fortune.
Mr. Krabs: Bumping barnacles, yes. [laughs and holds up a dime] There she is.
SpongeBob: Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
Mr. Krabs: Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
SpongeBob: [jumps out of the Patrick costume] Yippee! I happily acquiesce.
SpongeBob: [holding a pan over the stove] Come on, stovie, pop that corn! [popcorn bag grows enormously huge] Get ready, Gary. [trips over Gary landing in the chair] Incoming! [popcorn bag explodes everywhere]
Gary: Meow. [popcorn ricochets everywhere and piles up to SpongeBob's waist]
SpongeBob: Popcorn is served! [eats a piece of popcorn while music plays on TV]
Medley: That, bro, is trouble at any car wash.
TV Announcer: We will return to "Bikini Bottom Car Wash" after these messages.
Commercial Announcer: Are you boring?
Charlie: Yes, yes I am.
Commercial Announcer: When friends describe you, do they use words like... [words appear as they are being said] "dull!" or "drab!?"
Charlie: [laughs] Don't forget "platitudinous". [word appears over his head. A mystical head floats beside Charlie]
Commercial Announcer: Yes, that too, Charlie. But what if I told you that you can change all that with the magic of... magic! [turns Charlie into a magician]
Charlie: [laughs] I look like some kind of magician. Now people won't ignore me.
Commercial Announcer: Let's hope not, Charlie. With my "Mister Magic Magical Magic Kit", even you can impress and amaze your friends.
SpongeBob: [holds on to the TV] I want to impress and amaze my friends!
Commercial Announcer: Just send $19.95 to me, Mister Magic. [SpongeBob puts an envelope into the mail slot, then takes the post office mail can and stuffs it in 'Outgoing Mail']
Narrator: 4 to 6 weeks later...
Mailman: One magic kit and another one of these yellow things. [stuffs both into SpongeBob's mailbox then drives off]
SpongeBob: [gets out of his mailbox and rips the packaging off the box that came in the mail] Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit. [opens the box and gasps] Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic. [notices Squidward to the side slurping a drink] Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill.
Squidward: Brine soda, low-fast seaweed crisps, cool jazz. [eats a seaweed crisp] Mm, mm, Squidward you have done it. You have officially spoiled yourself rotten.
SpongeBob: Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!
Squidward: Magic? Can you make yourself disappear, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard. [Squidward's eye twitches] No, I better start with something simpler. [gets out a deck of cards] Say card conjuring. [Squidward is now depressed more than ever] Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see... [reads his book of spells] step 1...
Squidward: [sighs] This can't possibly end soon.
SpongeBob: Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic. [juggles the three balls in and out of his holes on his body]
Squidward: [steps onto the bus that just pulled up] I don't care where I'm going, just take me away from here. [bus drives off]
SpongeBob: Then take one card and shove it in your ear. [does so. A car drives by with Tom in the driver's seat and his son Monroe in the passenger seat bawling]
Monroe: But I don't like pistachio!
Tom: Then why did you ask for it? [drives into a bump, which causes the ice cream to fly out the car and into Squidward's lawn chair. Monroe starts crying loudly]
[The pistachio ice cream cone lands in Squidward's sunbathing chair]
SpongeBob: And finally, say the words "Hobris-Pobris". [gasps] Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice cream cone. Which means... I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form. [looks at his book of spells] Presto! [nothing happens] Uh, let's see. Umm... A-ha! Alakazam! [gasps] Abracadabra. [gasps] Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. [sniffs] I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible. [cut to "The Reef" where SpongeBob and Squidward, as an ice cream cone, are watching a movie. Ice cream cone tilts over into SpongeBob's arm and makes him smile. Cut to SpongeBob reading Squidward a story. Cut to the beach where SpongeBob and Squidward are lying on a towel trying to get a tan. SpongeBob looks over and notices melting ice cream cone] Whoa-oh! [a beach goer, who is trying to catch a Frisbee, slips in the ice cream cone. SpongeBob screams, then runs over to Squidward] Squidward! Speak to me! Speak! [breathes heavily as he runs to his house and puts the cone in the freezer] Hey, Squid, are you okay? [closes freezer door then reopens it] Hey, Squid, are you still okay? [winks, then closes door, reopens it again screaming then laughing] Hey, Squidward, I got something for ya! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer. [set a pink ice cream cone next to Squidward] Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy.
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?
SpongeBob: I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert.
Patrick: That's awful. How tragic. Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: It's all my fault.
Patrick: Did you say frozen dessert? [takes the green ice cream cone out of the freezer]
SpongeBob: Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone. [cries]
Patrick: Oh...soft serve. [licks ice cream cone]
SpongeBob: [yells as he points to the ice cream] Patrick! Stop eating Squidward!
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [licks it a few more times]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick licks it again] Pat...!
Patrick: But he's so tasty! [licks it more faster. SpongeBob screams, then he snatches the cone away from Patrick]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! Don't you understand!? [calmly] This isn't just your ordinary ice cream cone.
Patrick: It's pistachio.
SpongeBob: [frustrated] No! It's Squidward! [ice cream begins to melt as SpongeBob is unaware] And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged. [Patrick is licking the melted ice cream off the floor. SpongeBob screams again, believing that his friend was deceased.] Patrick! Squidward has melted! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?! [screams and hits himself in the face with the magic kit each time] It's all your fault! [throws the magic kit on the ground and stomps on it] Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems!
Patrick: [examines the torn box] Warning: From ages 9 to 99.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us: Mister Magic! [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking down a brown tileroad] Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person.
Deep Male Voice: Enter! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a floating hat] Who dares to see Mister Magic?! [SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming] Speak up!
SpongeBob: It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice cream. [he shows him the cone floating in the melted green goo inside a jar, which is his "deceased friend"]
Mister Magic: [proudly] Good job.
SpongeBob: Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back.
Mister Magic: Hmmm, um, well, have you ever thought of a different hobby?
SpongeBob: I need your help to change him back.
Mister Magic: My help? [sheepishly] Uh, no thank you.
SpongeBob: [still concerned] But if you don't, my friend will be a cone forever.
Mister Magic: Sorry, I... umm... I'm out to lunch, that's it.
SpongeBob: I'll wait.
Mister Magic: I'm on a two-year lunch.
SpongeBob: [still showing the jar] Oh, please.
Mister Magic: Silence! [Patrick notices something near the wall and walks to it]
SpongeBob: But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery. [Patrick opens the curtain to reveal someone behind it making Mister Magic noises]
Mister Magic: Thank...you.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, there's a guy over here talking into a tubey thing.
Horace: Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.
Mister Magic: [simultaneously with Horace] Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.
Patrick: Why's he saying the same thing Mister Magic's saying?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir?
Horace: Well, I... uh... I'm Horace B. Magic.
SpongeBob: Are you Mister Magic?
Horace: [chuckles] Technically, yes. But the only magic around here is the magic of business. [shows a bunch of dollar bills]
SpongeBob: Does that mean you can't change my friend back?
Horace: [chuckles] I'm, I'm afraid not. So sorry about that, laddie. Your refund check is in the mail.
SpongeBob: I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways! [his eyes tear up] You have ruined my faith in the magical arts. [screaming, crying]
Horace: [frowns] Security. [SpongeBob and Patrick are booted out. Cut to both of them by Squidward's lawn chair with SpongeBob still crying over the "funeral" held for "Squidward"]
SpongeBob: [tears roll down his cheeks] What are we going to do about Squidward?
Patrick: We could always eat him. I'm kind of hungry. [stomach growls]
SpongeBob: Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!... [continues to speak gibberish as a bus drives up and Squidward steps off, grinning in a friendly manner. He walks over to the lawn chair with the jar and the melted green ice cream, much to his disgust]
Squidward: Ew. [throws the jar with the cone in it away. The jar breaks] What are you doing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [stops crying] Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked. [puts on his magician hat] I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now? [motorcycle approaches]
Squidward: Hey, stop! [motorcycle stops and Squidward jumps on it] Get me out of here!
Patrick: [stomach growls] Hey, SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself?
SpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica. [Patrick is now a giant jar of mayonnaise. The jar sparkles]
Narrator: It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School with Patrick] I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?
Patrick: Right here, buddy. [takes them out of his pocket] Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. [eats the cards] Mmm.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick!
Patrick: Hey, learning tastes good.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those.
Patrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.
SpongeBob: 57 times.
Patrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.
SpongeBob: I'm a winner?
Patrick: Who's a winner?
SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm a winner.
Patrick: Who's a winner?
SpongeBob: [cheered up a little] I'm a winner.
Patrick: Who's a winner?!
SpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! [runs into the classroom]
Narrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later... [SpongeBob walks up crying]
Patrick: How'd you do, winner? [SpongeBob's crying continues] Let's see that license.
SpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick.
Patrick: Are they gonna mail it to you?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.
Patrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.
SpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick.
Patrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.
SpongeBob: [hanging onto Patrick's pants] No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. [Patrick's pants rip off]
Patrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. No!
Mrs. Puff: [Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear] Good morning.
Patrick: You're not the judge of me!
Mrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! [clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school]
SpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'm here for you, buddy.
Patrick: I passed my test!
SpongeBob: You got a perfect score?
Patrick: Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.
SpongeBob: Perfect score. [eye twitches]
Patrick: Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. [scene cuts to the license registration building]
Miss Shell: Stand behind the line, sir.
Patrick: [smiling] How do I look?
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Like a winner.
Miss Shell: Ready?
Patrick: Ready. [banner comes down which says "CONGRATULATIONS" on it. Balloons and confetti fall]
SpongeBob: Huh?
Fish: Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.
Patrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain?
Fish: Uhh, no.
Patrick: Oh.
Fish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.[Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as Spongebob's jaw drops]
Patrick: Yeah! All right!
Fish: Women will want you. [all sigh] Men will want to be you. [all faint] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob growling angrily]
Patrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.
SpongeBob: I'm so happy for you... ["La Cucaracha" horn blows in his face] Whoa!
Patrick: The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
Patrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
SpongeBob: Two millionth?
Patrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me.
SpongeBob: Yeah, just like you.
Patrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
SpongeBob: Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours.
Patrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. [shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. [SpongeBob groans and slam his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am]
SpongeBob: 4:00? [yawns. Doorbell rings] Who could be at the door at this hou— [falls down the stairs. Opens the door] Now what is it, Patrick?
Patrick: You will never guess what happen to me today.
SpongeBob: You got your license.
Patrick: Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all.
SpongeBob: You got a new boat.
Patrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off]
SpongeBob: [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting very angry]
SpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
SpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru?
Mr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
SpongeBob: I used to have a dream.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
SpongeBob: [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— ["La Cucaracha" horn honks]
Patrick: The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick?
Patrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving]
Patrick: Boy, driving is so easy.
SpongeBob: Oh?
Patrick: Do you want me to give you lessons?
SpongeBob: [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great.
Patrick: Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
Mr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?
Patrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
Mrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick.
Patrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.
SpongeBob: Mom!
Patrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
SpongeBob: Hey. [Patrick drives off]
Mr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh]
Patrick: Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH']
SpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob: [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman]
Patrick: What? Where? Who?
SpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
Officer: Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off]
SpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through red lights] Patrick, you just ran three red lights!
Patrick: So?
SpongeBob: You're suppose to stop!
Patrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.
SpongeBob: [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
Patrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
SpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
Patrick: How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
SpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
Patrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises]
SpongeBob: [fixes his face and then snatches Patrick's license out of his hand]Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [tears up Patrick's license then laughs. The pieces of the license fly into the cop’s hands]
Officer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob &amp; Patrick]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: It's the police!
Officer: [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug!
Patrick: Litterbug?! No! [drives faster]
Officer: Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
Patrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom]
Judge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.
Patrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
SpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
Judge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail]
Narrator: One debt to society later... [door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob! [both hug]
SpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. [shows him a license plate that reads "PALS 4 EVER"] Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
Patrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
SpongeBob: Oh, then what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind]
Patrick: How's that?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Patrick: Ready, buddy?
SpongeBob: Ready, pal. [hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises] Woo! Woo!
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets. [gasps as he sees a blue jellyfish] Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger!
Gold Throated Singer: La, la, la, la, la, la, la!
SpongeBob: Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one! [SpongeBob and Patrick are over-shadowed]
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob? [looks up and sees a bunch of colorful jellyfish above them]
SpongeBob: Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable! [opens his case to a metal net instead of one made of bamboo sticks. He catches many jellyfish while Patrick struggles to catch one. Scene cuts to the bus stop]
SpongeBob: Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.
Patrick: Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net. [his net breaks]
SpongeBob: Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.
Patrick: Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky. [shudders. Scene cuts to the bus dropping off Patrick and SpongeBob on their street]
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick.
Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [in his bed] Ah, I love jellyfishing. [night breaks into day quickly and the foghorn alarm goes off] Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable. [realizes he doesn't have it] Ol' Reliable? [gasps] It's gone! [runs out the door in his underwear]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, right. Pants.
Narrator: One pair of pants later...
SpongeBob: Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen! [both scream. Scene cuts to them stapling posters saying "STOLEN! OL' RELIABLE"]
SpongeBob: Put one over there, Patrick.
Patrick: I'm all done.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should spread out a little. [newspaper ad of the "Bikini Bottom Gazette" reads "STOLEN OL' RELIABLE" on the front page]
Johnny: Flash. The jellyfish migration enters it second day of fantastic jellyfishing. We now go live to our reporter on the scene.
Perch Perkins: [in Jellyfish Fields] This year's migration is the largest in a century! I feel truly sorry for the poor saps that will miss even one minute of this remarkable event. [SpongeBob takes Perch's microphone]
SpongeBob: Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return. [Mr. Krabs sees this on TV at home and runs to Jellyfish Fields then appears on TV instantly]
Mr. Krabs: Reward? How much we talkin' about?
SpongeBob: 12 dollars and... [counts the coins] ...38 cents.
Mr. Krabs: I'm on the case. [takes SpongeBob's money and runs off screen while Perch takes back his microphone]
Perch Perkins: Guys, I know it's a slow news day, but come on. [The scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in his chair by the phone when it rings. He picks it up.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Hello? Hello?
Patrick: SpongeBob, did you get your net back?
SpongeBob: Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [hangs up. The phone rings again] Did you get your net yet?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. [hangs up. The phone rings again]
SpongeBob: Hello?!
Patrick: SpongeBob, I found your net!
SpongeBob: What?! Really, Patrick?
Patrick: Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. [looks out his window and notices Patrick running around with a jellyfish net]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net. [gets in bed] Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. [his eyes widen. Scene cuts to morning. Patrick walks up to SpongeBob's pineapple]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?
SpongeBob: [sighs] No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net? [Patrick laughs then stops]
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.
Patrick: A present? What is it?
SpongeBob: [pulls out a bear with a microphone in its hand] It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
Patrick: Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
[He quickly dashes off to speak for the bear.]
SpongeBobConfess-A-Bear: Hi! My name is Confess-A-Bear! Tell me all your secrets.
Patrick: Um, [sits on the ground] I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.
SpongeBobConfess-A-Bear: Oh, maybe you should talk about it.
Patrick: Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.
SpongeBobConfess-A-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear!
Patrick: I've said too much already.
SpongeBobConfess-a-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear now! Now!
Patrick: Ahh! I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear? [SpongeBob runs around in the background screaming and wiping his tongue off in disgust] You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear? [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Patrick's rock]
SpongeBob: Patrick, we need to talk.
Patrick: Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... [walks down some stairs into Patrick's rock] Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?
Patrick: I'm in here. Be out in a second. [Patrick's shadow reveals himself holding a jellyfishing net]
SpongeBob: Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.
Patrick: [Standing with his hands behind his back] Hello.
SpongeBob: What's in your hand, Patrick?
Patrick: [shows his left hand] Nothing.
SpongeBob: What's in your other hand?
Patrick: [grows another arm through his chest] Nothing in my other hand.
SpongeBob: Well, I gotta go.
Patrick: Okay, bye.
SpongeBob: Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he? [imagines Patrick from earlier]
Patrick: I would kill for a net like that! [takes out a carrot, breaks it in half, and laughs maniacally]
SpongeBob: [screams] Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure. [scene cuts to the next day] Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What are you going to do today, buddy?
Patrick: Eh, nothing.
SpongeBob: [puts on his Krusty Krab hat] Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick.
Patrick: Bye. [SpongeBob walks off then sneaks into a bush in the background]
SpongeBob: Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants. [looks through binoculars]
Narrator: Eight hours later...
SpongeBob: [still looking through binoculars] Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go? [Patrick is behind him]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing. I just finished. [takes out his to-do list and crosses out 'Nothing'] Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here. [shudder] Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?
SpongeBob: [yells and throws away the binoculars] I don't have any binoculars, see?
Patrick: You're acting weird.
SpongeBob: I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird! [runs off panting] You're... acting... weird!
Patrick: Okay, bye! [later, SpongeBob knocks on Patrick's rock] Hello! Who are you?
SpongeBob: [wearing a mustache. British accent] Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean.
Patrick: Oh. No.
SpongeBob: Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm.
Patrick: What street said that? Was it this one? [points at the street] Mind your own business!
SpongeBob: Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net. [shows a fake $1,000,000,000 bill that is colored on with crayon] I will pay one billion dollars for that net.
Patrick: I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net! [holds the jellyfishing case out] I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Patrick: You can't have it for any price.
SpongeBob: And why not?
Patrick: This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.
SpongeBob: [rips off the mustache. Normal voice] A-ha!
Patrick: SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.
SpongeBob: Patrick, [puts on the mustache] I'm the scary mustache guy!
Patrick: [screams] Why, SpongeBob, why?! Why would you wear such a scary mustache?
SpongeBob: [rips off the mustache] Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?!
Patrick: What?!!!? I'm your best friend!
SpongeBob: You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!
Patrick: How could you think that?
SpongeBob: Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!
Patrick: Gift.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: It's my friend SpongeBob's gift. [opens the case up to reveal a new jellyfishing net] I made you a new net.
SpongeBob: [reads inscription] For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you! Patrick? [a bunch of stuff is on the ground]
[Patrick puts the TV in the pile.]
SpongeBob: What'cha doing, best friend?
Patrick: I'm not your best friend. I'm just a no-good jelly netting thief fish!
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
Patrick: I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! [bus stops in front of them] So, this is it?
Patrick: Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.
SpongeBob: [hands onto Patrick's left foot] Patrick, don't go! I'm sorry I accused you! It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.
Nat Peterson: What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two. [shows SpongeBob his net] Look, you left your net on the bus again.
SpongeBob: Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?
Nat Peterson: You do it every week. Now can we get going?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by.
Patrick: You're giving me Ol' Reliable? [cries loudly] I accept your apology!
SpongeBob: Oh, come here, you big lug! [both hug and cry loudly]
All: Aww...
Nat Peterson: They do this all the time. I'm serious. I--ugh, never mind.
Patrick: I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!
Passengers: Hooray! [bus drives off]
Patrick: You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net. [holds up Ol' Reliable]
SpongeBob: So did I. [holds up the one Patrick made for him] My best friend made it for me.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Whee! [both laugh and run into Jellyfish Fields, where the exotic jellyfish are still there]
Squidward: [sighs happily] I love waking up to my own circadian rhythm without the aid of an alarm clock. [notices SpongeBob standing next to his bed]
SpongeBob: Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward? [SpongeBob is spit out of the island head, into the air] Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later! [cuts to Squidward planting. Right before he puts in a plant, he sees SpongeBob's face in the hole] Hi, Squidward, wanna play?
Squidward: No, and leave me alone! [puts the plant in the hole, covering SpongeBob's face. Then a flower springs from the ground with SpongeBob's face on it]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in front of a canvas]
Squidward: Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create. [right before he begins to paint, SpongeBob's face appears on the canvas]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, wanna play? [Squidward paints a giant red 'NO' on the canvas] Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in his library]
Squidward: [sighs] Perhaps I can find solitude in the printed word. [Opens book and SpongeBob jumps out]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, wanna play? [Squidward shuts book, with SpongeBob in it, and puts it back on the shelf. Muffled] Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in his bathtub while playing with his nose. He notices SpongeBob watching him from his window and screams] Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first. [closes the curtain] Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins. [laughs] Defeat has never tasted so sweet. [phone rings] Yello? [SpongeBob's mouth pops through the receiver into his ear]
SpongeBob: How 'bout a game of hangman?
Squidward: How 'bout a game of hang up? [slams down phone] Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating. [as he walks out of the bathtub, he is sprayed in the face with mud. SpongeBob is drilling into his bathroom]
SpongeBob: How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks &amp; Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings &amp; Queens? Mahjong? [Squidward is beginning to fume and he picks up SpongeBob and shakes him angrily] Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?
Squidward: It's called, "I will never play with you... [yells in SpongeBob’s ear] ...ever!" [throws SpongeBob into the hole and moves the refrigerator over it]
SpongeBob: Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward... [jumps out of hole] I'll just make one of my own! [fridge falls on top of Squidward, squishing him. He squirms out from under it and sees SpongeBob running back to his house]
Squidward: I think that moron finally gets it! I don't want to see or hear him for the... [pneumatic tools whirring and grinding are heard from SpongeBob's house. Squidward walks over to his house] SpongeBob! Will you make that racket stop?! SpongeBob, you open this door right this... [door opens and knocks Squidward down]
Mini Squid: Hello, Squidward. [Squidward screams and hides behind a bush] Squidward! It's me, Mini Squidward!
Squidward: What are you doing, SpongeBob?
Mini Squid: Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: What manner of annoying scheme is this?
SpongeBob: Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is.
Squidward: Hi. Now, SpongeBob, what the...?
SpongeBob: Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name.
Squidward: [sighs] Hello, Squidward.
Mini Squid: Wondrous weather we're having, eh, Squidward, old pal?
Squidward: SpongeBob, what is the meaning of this?
Mini Squid: SpongeBob made a replacement you: me. So when you you don't want to play, SpongeBob will play with me-you.
Squidward: So, you'll be filling in for me when SpongeBob wants to play one of his stupid games?
Mini Squid: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you! [kisses Mini Squid then runs off laughing hysterically] Woo-hoo-hoo! [pole vaults through his house window. SpongeBob and Mini Squid look at each other. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mini Squid sitting next to SpongeBob's pineapple playing charades]
Mini Squid: Three words. Movie title. [gasps] "12 Angry Jellyfish."
SpongeBob: How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you.
Patrick: [to Mini Squid] Squidward, you look a little different. Wow. Have you been working out?
SpongeBob: Actually, Patrick, this is...
Patrick: D'oh, hold it, SpongeBob. Ooh, I know. You shaved your beard. [SpongeBob and Mini Squid look at each other. Scene cuts to Squidward working at the Krusty Krab serving Krabby Patties to a couple, sounding monotone]
Squidward: Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty? [The customers are silent and look irritated] See... 'cause... they're both... krabby. [SpongeBob and Mini Squid walk in]
SpongeBob: Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?
Mini Squid: Of course, I am. I love to work!
Sandals: Who is that little fellow with SpongeBob?
Suzy Fish: I don't know, but isn't he handsome?
Sandals: Yeah, he is handsome. [Squidward starts mumbling] Ahem.
Squidward: Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Sandals: No. I don't like your attitude, bub. Is this what the Krusty Krab calls friendly service? [Mini Squid pops up from under the cash register]
Mini Squid: Sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Sandals: Now that's more like it. Finally, a server with a good attitude.
Mini Squid: Well, thank you very much.
Sandals: I'll take eight dozen of your finest patties, please. But don't let old chowder pants over there touch them. He might taint the patties.
Squidward: Fine then. Do my work for me. [puts his hat on Mini Squid's head and walks away]
Squidward: I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back. I could get used to this.
SpongeBob: Order up, Mini Squid!
Mini Squid: Okay, SpongeBob. Always happy to help. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Here you go, pal! [flips six patties on Mini Squid's plate] Go get em', tiger! [Mini Squid walks over to the customers]
Mini Squid: Okay, now, who had the Krabby Patty, and who had the Krabby Patty? [both fish laugh]
Squidward: What the...? That's my joke!
Sandals: Wow, honey, this new Mini Squidward is such a card!
Suzy Fish: And a great waiter, dear.
Sandals: Yeah. You're right. So much better than that old, lousy, larger-scale Squidward. [Squidward mumbles angrily]
Suzy Fish: Yeah! Bring that little fella over here and let me give him a $300 dollar tip! [shows $300]
Squidward: What? All right, all right! That's enough! My break is finished. [walks behind cash register]
Squidward: Oh boy! Back to work!
Mr. Krabs: Hold on a second, there.
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Squidward, me cephalopod, I'm sorry to tell you this — well, not that sorry — the customers prefer the new smaller Squidward to you. And so do I! 'Cause he's making me some bucks! So I'm changing your job to busboy, effective immediately. [hands Squidward dirty dishes] Now pipe down and watch how it's done.
Mini Squid: Hey, everybody! I'm Squidward and I love to dance.
Jimmy Gus: I, for one, love to watch people dance while I eat. Who's with me? Who wants Mini Squidward to dance for our amusement? [everyone cheers]
Mini Squid: Well, gosh, okay. [SpongeBob changes Mini Squid into a purple aerobics outfit. Mini Squid starts dancing when the music starts. Some customers dance the same thing Mini Squid and SpongeBob are dancing]
Squidward: What's the big deal? Those are all my moves! [dances the exact same moves but no one is impressed] Ta-da!
Fred: [gasps] Talk about no talent!
Harold: Maybe Squidward should get sized-reduction surgery so he'll dance better! [everyone laughs]
Squidward: That Mini Squid... [Mini Squid continues to dance and plays the clarinet to everyone's amazement]
Mini Squid: Everybody dance! [everyone dances. Music stops and Mini Squid takes a bow]
Squidward: That was awful! [all cheer for Mini Squid and Squidward begins to fume]
Squidward: He stole my jokes... he stole my job... he stole my standing ovation! You little wooden fiend! Stop stealing my life! [walks over and does bodily harm to Mini Squid before an agent shows up]
Talent Agent: Stop, stop! Don't gnaw on the head of my new client, please! You don't know what you're doing. Are you mad? Have mercy!
Squidward: Wait a minute. I've seen you before. You're that music agent that represents my favorite clarinet player.
Talent Agent: Salutations! I'm Milo J. Finkerfish: manager for "Curly Bubbles Records."
Squidward: You mean you're here to sign me up for a record deal?
Milo: The answer to that question is a big N-O. [points to Mini Squid] This little fella on the other hand is woo-hoo woo-hoo good! We're offering him a million dollar contract and a sequin suit.
Squidward: [gasps] A sequin suit?! That's what you're supposed to offer me! Why take a cheap knock off when you can have the original. [plays a lively tune on his clarinet and dances]
Squidward: Now, where do I sign? [Milo laughs]
Milo: Yeah, right, kid! [takes Mini Squid]
SpongeBob: Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies! [laughs] Remember?
Mini Squid: Yep, those were the days.
SpongeBob: But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. Arrivederci, mon frere.
Milo: Alright, kid, let's go become a sensation. Oh, and I'll see you at the Clammy Awards. Oh no, I guess I won't. [laughs, coughs and leaves]
SpongeBob: [Squidward cries] Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?
Squidward: My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't have to see that Mini Squid ever again!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I have something even better! [takes out a mini SpongeBob] Another me! [Mini SpongeBob and SpongeBob laugh back and forth while Squidward's eye twitches]
SpongeBob: ♪Mr. Sun came up, and he smiled at me. Said, "It's gonna be a good one just wait and see." Jumped out of bed and I ran outside feeling so extra ecstatified. It's the best day ever!♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
SpongeBob: Hey, Gary!
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Why is this the best day ever, you ask? Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession: the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro! And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital! I am so excited I think I'm gonna explode! [explodes into pieces then walks out of his house] ♪It's the best day ever♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
[SpongeBob laughs then tries opening the door to the Krusty Krab but can't because it's locked]
Mr. Krabs: Get out of the way, boy! [SpongeBob flies off the door and bounces into Mr. Krabs] Me building's been condemned, boy! We got ourselves a nematode infestation! [Nematodes come and eat the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs faints]
SpongeBob: But... the best day ever starts at the Krusty Krab! Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave! [nematodes eat his pants] Ohhhh! Guys, you're ruining the [off-key] best day... [clears throat] Wait, no. [off-key] Best day... [plays his nose as a flute. The nematodes line up. When SpongeBob stops, the nematodes walk up] Huh? [plays the 'best day ever' tune. The nematodes chatter excitedly. They follow SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Keep playing, lad! Take them devil's sons of the sea away from me restaurant! [later, SpongeBob stops playing and falls over due to being tired. The nematodes fall asleep, also. SpongeBob's watch beeps]
SpongeBob: Whoa! I gotta get to Sandy's! [scene cuts to Sandy's treedome. SpongeBob opens up her door then jumps behind a bush] Wait ‘til Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah! [karate chops the box the gloves were in. Then he chuckles and jumps onto the top of the treedome and sticks due to his gloves. He moves above her tree and falls through it and lands on a tree branch, then jumps at her] Hyah! [Sandy ducks and SpongeBob hits her buckets of water]
Sandy: [standing on a ladder, using a bucket to catch water in] SpongeBob, what on Earth are you doing?!
SpongeBob: Oh, just a little something I like to call karate!
Sandy: I can't right now, SpongeBob. I got a leak in my roof the size of a full-grown quarter horse!
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm. I see. Okay, then. I'll come back later. [walks off, but then reappears by Sandy and tries to karate chop her]
Sandy: Knock... it... off! [punches SpongeBob up high. The leak stops] It stopped? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Sandy: Hang on! I'm going to get some sealant and patch and trowel! [runs into her treedome]
SpongeBob: [groans] Oh. [slips out of his glove and falls. Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking to Jellyfish Fields] Oh, no Krabby Patties, no karate. But at least I still have jellyfishing with... Hey, there he is now! [sees Patrick chasing a jellyfish] Wait for me, Patrick. I've got a brand-new... [Patrick is crying] What's wrong, Patrick?
Patrick: I broke my net! [sobbing]
SpongeBob: Well, lucky for you, I brought my old net. [Patrick grabs it]
Patrick: For me? [giggles]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new... [Patrick's jellyfish net breaks. He cries]
Patrick: [bawling] SpongeBob! I broke... could I use this one? [points to SpongeBob's new net]
SpongeBob: Well, actually, Patrick, that's my brand-new net.
Patrick: Yeah? [cut to later where SpongeBob is waiting for his net while Patrick uses it]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's my turn, now. [Patrick ignores him] Hey, Patrick? Pat, old buddy. P-Patrick? It's-it's my turn now. [sighs] I guess I'll see you at the concert. [cut to SpongeBob walking at night to the concert, sadly] It's the best day ever. It's the best day ever. Oh, this best day ever isn't going so good. [takes out notebook and pencil and cancels "Jellyfishing w Patrick"] No work, no karate, no jellyfishing. Hey, I still have Squidward's concert! I won't let this one slip through my fingers. [cut to Squidward bawling outside the Bikini Bottom Recreation Center, in his uniform] Hey, Squidward. Squidward, what's wrong?
Squidward: The concert is ruined! My reed is shot. [shows it] See? I'm finished!
SpongeBob: [slaps Squidward] Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one!
Squidward: [sobbing] But my reed! [SpongeBob pulls one of his front teeth out and uses it as a reed]
SpongeBob: Now play!
Squidward: But... [SpongeBob slaps him]
SpongeBob: I said play! [Squidward plays]
Squidward: Not bad. [SpongeBob slaps him again]
SpongeBob: Now get in there and give me a concert to remember! [suddenly, an usher grabs him]
Usher: Where do you think you're going, kid?
SpongeBob: I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet. Today's my best day ever!
Usher: Where's you're ticket?
SpongeBob: One ticket, coming right up, cap'n! [searches his pocket] Must be here somewhere. [takes off his pants and dumps out what is in it] I don't have a ticket.
Usher: No ticket, no entry.
SpongeBob: But...
Usher: No ticket, no entry! [cut to a SpongeBob puppet on strings coming down]
SpongeBob Puppet: Oh, dear! I don't have a ticket. But I want to go to the show. Hmmm... what should I do? Oh, I know. I'll just sneak in the back door. [leaves]
Usher: Oh, no you don't! [runs after him as SpongeBob climbs down the wall, laughing]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob, you are so... [walks backwards into an usher puppet]
Usher Puppet: Ticket, please. [Later, SpongeBob, wearing a ski mask, is climbing up the side of the building and through the vent on the roof. He uses a flamethrower to cut his way through a door, which is actually the entry doors. The usher kicks him away from the building. Cut to later, where Mrs. Puff drives up in her boat and gets out, walking up to the usher]
Usher: Ticket, ma'am.
Mrs. Puff: Certainly. [reaches into her purse. She hears some giggling and takes out what it is] SpongeBob?
Usher: You? This time, I'm gonna... Wait a minute! Did you say SpongeBob? SpongeBob SquarePants? You're on the VIP list. [the usher carries SpongeBob on a pillow to his seat]
SpongeBob: [gasps] A reserved seat? Next to my friends? I made it! All I have to do is sit down and... [everyone applauds as the curtains close, and SpongeBob completely loses it. yells in frustration as everyone looks at him in confusion] NOOOOOO! (jumps on stage and tears the curtain) No! It is not over!
Fish: Huh?
SpongeBob: This was supposed to be my perfect day. But then everything... [a fish gets up and starts to leave. screams] SIT DOWN! [the fish does so] Then everything turned to doo-doo. [Mr. Krabs, Patrick and Sandy go upstage with him]
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No, it's not okay! [his yelling makes Mr. Krabs and Patrick flinch] This was gonna be my best day ever, starting with doing the best job in the world: working at the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Yeah, I guess so. But then I was gonna do karate with Sandy.
Sandy: I know, but you saved the treedome! Pretty cool, if you ask me.
SpongeBob: Well, I suppose. But then I was gonna go jellyfishing with Patrick.
Patrick: But then you... Uh, what'd you do again?
Squidward: And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust.
Mr. Krabs: You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things.
SpongeBob: [starting to feel calm] It's not?
Mr. Krabs: No. [chuckles] It's about us!
SpongeBob: It is?
Mr. Krabs: Yep. And since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you.
SpongeBob: You do?
Mr. Krabs: So, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours. [SpongeBob smiles and scene cuts to Mr. Krabs coming on stage with the light shining on him] Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Bikini Bottom Players proudly present a very expensive production of... "The Best Day Ever!" And it better be good for all it's costing me.
SpongeBob: ♪My perfect job starts my perfect day.♪ [flips a patty] ♪Then it's time to kick back, relax and play.♪ [practices karate with Sandy. She kicks him. He land next to Patrick. Jellyfishes comes up in the scene]
Mr. Krabs: That wasn't in the budget!
SpongeBob: ♪Sing along. Hear that happy sound♪
Patrick: ♪Don't let those sour notes bring you down.♪
Squidward: Hey!
SpongeBob: ♪That's where it's at!♪ [crashes spotlight]
Mr. Krabs: I'm not paying for that!
SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪
Echo: ♪Best day ever♪
Squidward: How long do we have to keep this up?
Mr. Krabs: Just till his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just till his little heart gives out.
Patrick: Best Friends Day! Best Friends Day! Best Friends Day! Best Friends Day! [giggling]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Happy Best Friend... whoa.
Patrick: This chewing gum is my most beloved possession, and I'm giving it to my bestest friend, on Best Friends Day.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I am truly honored and... [cries]
Patrick: What's wrong, buddy?
SpongeBob: You got me such an amazing gift, and all I got you was...that. [a robot comes out]
Robo 2.1: Greetings. I am Robo 2.1, your personal robot servant. I am proficient in providing over 250,000 creature comforts. Would you care for a pastry? [shoots a pastry into Patrick's mouth]
Patrick: Yum! Sweet, hot, and juicy. SpongeBob, this is a great gift!
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum.
Patrick: Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, SpongeBob. I love my gift. In fact, I'll go play with it right now! Come on, Robo!
Robo 2.1: Coming, Master Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, you don't mind if I say goodbye to Gummy, do you?
SpongeBob: No, not at all.
Patrick: Thanks. Goodbye, Gummy. You be good to SpongeBob, you hear? [pokes his finger in the ball of gum and it squirts out water on Patrick] I love you, too, Gummy. [hugs it] Welp, he's all yours!
SpongeBob: O, majestic and much masticated Gummy, although I am not worthy to be in your presence, may my humble abode please you. [struggles to push the giant ball of gum in his house. Breaks his arms in half in the process] Oh, you sure are a big boy, aren't you? Ooh. Hey, I know how to handle this! With a little karate! Hyah! [rolls the giant ball of gum into his pineapple. Crawls out using his legs] Whew! Oh, Gummy, what a beautiful centerpiece you make. With your dirty sock and used toothbrush, flies, and moldy pizza. [sniffs and almost barfs] Get a hold of yourself, SpongeBob. It's not so bad. After all, it is a gift from Patrick. [a pair of underwear come out of the gum slithers onto SpongeBob's cringing face]
Underwear: [raspy and demonic] You're...not... Patrick...! [SpongeBob screams and runs into another room]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go! [cut to SpongeBob taking the ball of gum out of the garage and holds it up] Goodbye, stink ball. See ya never! [throws it on top of his garbage can]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, whatcha doing? [Robo is carrying Patrick on a mattress]
Robo 2.1: It appears that he is throwing Gummy away.
Patrick: What? Is that true?
SpongeBob: No way, Patrick.
Patrick: Then how do you explain this? [points to Gummy on the garbage can]
SpongeBob: Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up! [puts the garbage can top on Gummy] Isn't this a cute look?
Patrick: Hmmm. Bold yet understated. Brilliant idea, SpongeBob! Keep up the good work. Come on, Robo, let's find more belly button lint. [cut to SpongeBob digging a giant hole]
SpongeBob: [peeking out from the hole] Okay, no sign of Patrick. Better make this fast. [drives a bulldozer towards Gummy, ready to push it into the hole] Get ready for your dirt nap, Gummy! [laughs as the blade raises up, revealing Patrick and Robo sitting in it]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Ahhh...!
Patrick: What are you doing? [SpongeBob deflates] I'm waiting.
Narrator: "Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff". This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T. Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together.
Mrs. Puff: Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts...[cut to Squidward in a pilot uniform]
Squidward: Ripping good day for a spot of driving.
Mrs. Puff: ...and a driver without boat smarts. [cut to SpongeBob sliding in on his head upside down, next to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! [wiggles his legs. Squidward gets angry]
Mrs. Puff: Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure. [cut to Squidward putting air in his tires] Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level. [cut to SpongeBob pumping too much air in his tires] While this driver pays no need to boat smarts. [tires flips the boat over. Then the tire explodes and blows air into Squidward's face.] Buckling Up. [cut to Squidward putting on safety belt] As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision. [drives off but stops slowly at a stop light] Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign. [cut to SpongeBob driving his boat through town destructively without wearing his seat belt and laughing] Now this driver, with no regard for safety.[Squidward screams as SpongeBob slams into the backend of Squidward's boat, sending him flying into the air still in his seat and buckled up with the steering wheel in his hand. Squidward screams more as he sees a spiky steamroller driving on the road he is flying into. He tries to get his seat belt off but squeezes through the spikes anyways] Well, at least he had his seat belt on. [The boat, now cut in half, comes out of the steamroller and in it is Squidward, all injured. His seatbelt pops off.] Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now? [Squidward is adjusting his mirrors] You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater. [Beeping sound is heard. SpongeBob is running over citizens while he is adjusting his mirrors]
SpongeBob: Ah, perfect. [moves from behind Squidward in the road and drives in front of him]
Squidward: Hey, use your mirrors, fool!
SpongeBob: Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet. [adjusts it to where the light in the reflection blinds Squidward]
Squidward: Ah! Can't see! D'oh! [puts on sunglasses and giggles. Screams as he crashes into a brick wall. Footage from live-action Japanese Crash test dummy is showing with Squidward's head replacing the Japanese dummy's head. He slides out of his seat] Ow.
Mrs. Puff: Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road. [Squidward's eyes turn into a lock but vision the road as well. Cut to SpongeBob eating a Krabby Patty and reading the newspaper while driving] And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety. [SpongeBob is shaving himself while driving the wrong way on a one way street. Tom is shaking his fist, Sadie looks at SpongeBob and Fred shaking his fist in the air. He causes a woman to crash into a streetlight pole]
Sadie: [screams] Jerk!
SpongeBob: Hi there!
Nat: Help! Lunatic driver! [crashes his boat into SpongeBob's but SpongeBob's boat is unharmed and keeps driving.]
SpongeBob: How's it going? [He causes many drivers to flip their boats over and get in accidents]
Fish: [all screaming and talking at once] I can't feel my hair. My leg!
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law. [SpongeBob's boat slips in some water and spins around and around]
SpongeBob: Lalalalalalalalala! Whee! [his boat is driving backwards now] Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff. [Squidward and Mrs. Puff scream. SpongeBob's boat stops on a rock and tilts upward, causing Squidward's boat to fly up into the air then into the pile of boat mobiles that are in the accident. Mrs. Puff blows up to a big puffer fish]
SpongeBob: Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts! [laughs and drives off, making dust and the low quality video recorder stops]
Mrs. Puff: Never mind.
SpongeBob: [reading a story to Gary] And then, the ugly mollusk ran all the way home...
Patrick: [breaking through SpongeBob's wall] SpongeBob, you gotta see this! It's an emergency broadcast on my TV!
TV announcer: The day you've been waiting for is almost here. That's right. Glove World! has a new ride. It's big... [roller coaster goes above the water then back down into it]
TV announcer: It's fast... [Nancy and Harold are riding a roller coaster so fast, Harold flies off of it]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Harold, no!
TV announcer: It's painful... [roller coaster crashes into the ground, causing an explosion]
TV announcer: It's the "Fiery Fist O' Pain." Opening tomorrow only at Glove World!
Patrick: Tomorrow! SpongeBob, we gotta get to bed so we can be first in line! [Patrick hangs onto his TV and goes back to his rock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob sleeping]
SpongeBob: Glove World! Roller coaster. First in line. [SpongeBob dreams of him and Patrick at Glove World!. When they walk past the popcorn stand, it turns into a maggot stand and smoke fills the air]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain? [Grim reaper points to his left. SpongeBob and Patrick float over to the ride. When they get in it, it goes up above the water. They scream as it goes down. Lightning strikes the tracks, and makes the roller coaster fly off the track]
SpongeBob: In the name of amusement, no...! [SpongeBob and Patrick fall out of the coaster and into graves with their names on the tombstones. A digger puts all the dirt back in the hole]
SpongeBob: [screams] I don't want to ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain! [cut to next morning when SpongeBob's alarm goes off but he didn't sleep the whole night. Patrick appears by his bed]
Patrick: You ready to ride the Fist O' Pain?
SpongeBob: No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night.
Patrick: Really? Me too!
SpongeBob: What was your dream about, Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, look, the bus is here! [runs toward the bus]
SpongeBob: Wait for me, Patrick. [both get on the bus] Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come.
Timmy Monroe: Yeah, dudes, we're all riding the Fist O' Pain.
Boy #2: I heard somebody rode it and his spine fell out.
Timmy: [laughing] Dude, I hope my spine falls out.
Taylor: [laughing] Yeah, me too.
SpongeBob: Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds...
Patrick: Really, really scary. I mean fun-ifying. I mean horror-tastic. I mean fun-ible! Fun, really, really fun.
SpongeBob: Yeah, really fun. [bus stops at Glove World! and SpongeBob &amp; Patrick get off]
SpongeBob: That sure looks like fun.
Patrick: Yeah, I can't wait to ride it. [all the passengers on the bus run out and grab SpongeBob &amp; Patrick while cheering]
All: Yes, we're here! Whoo! [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are carries into a brick wall]
Employee: Tickets, please. [SpongeBob looks in his pockets but no ticket]
SpongeBob: No tickets. I must have left it at home.
Patrick: I swallowed my tickets.
SpongeBob: I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today.
Nat: Hold on a second, there's your tickets in your back pockets. [grabs them both]
SpongeBob: Oh, barnacles!. [cut to later when SpongeBob and Patrick are walking around the amusement park] It sure was lucky we found our tickets.
Patrick: Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck.
SpongeBob: There it is. The line looks awfully long.
Patrick: Oh, I know! Let's go on some of the dumb kiddie rides first.
SpongeBob: Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler. [both run off]
Patrick: Phew.
SpongeBob: Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
Patrick: Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!
SpongeBob: I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove! [a giant glove costume is standing in front of them] Get over there and I'll take your picture with him. [Patrick moves a few steps into the camera so he's not too close to Glovey Glove] Get closer, Patrick.
Patrick: Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob: Come on, closer. [Patrick moves a little closer] That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile. [takes the picture]
Patrick: How do I look? [pictures shows Patrick touching Glovey Glove with only a finger] Wow, I look great. [a little kid is laughing on one of the kiddie rides]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: The Mitten!
SpongeBob: [clears throat] I mean, The Mitten.
Patrick: That ride's for babies.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is. [both walk over and get into the ride, with the little kid. When they go over a bump, they scream. When the ride is over, they get out and both are shivering; the baby snaps his fingers at SpongeBob and Patrick and walks away]
Patrick: I guess that ride was too much for the little guy. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in line by the Fiery Fist O' Pain]
SpongeBob: Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride? [both chuckle nervously]
Patrick: Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters. [an old fish is wheel chaired out of Glove World!]
Old Man Jenkins: Oh, why, why, why? [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run off] Why won't you let me on the ride?
Harold: Sir, you have a serious medical condition.
Old Man Jenkins: But it's my birthday! [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick running through a line, cheering]
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: One more time!
Tom: You know, this is the line for the bathroom.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We've gone eight times.
Patrick: And I went three times all by myself.
Tom: I'm going to walk away now. [does so]
SpongeBob: Bye.
Patrick: Have fun! [Larry walks up]
Larry: SpongeBob! Patrick!
SpongeBob: Hello, Larry.
Larry: I just got off the Fist O' Pain. Man, what a rush. [sniffs his armpit then sighs in relief as a green odor is released from under his arm] You smell that? That's the smell of adrenaline. [SpongeBob's and Patrick's eyebrows disintegrate]
SpongeBob: Oh, it's, uh... [holding breath] very manly, Larry.
Larry: [picks up SpongeBob and smells him] SpongeBob, I'm not smelling any adrenaline on you. You haven't gone on the ride?
SpongeBob: Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry! [runs off]
Larry: Come on, Patrick. You and me, pal?
Patrick: I'm hungry, too. [runs off]
Larry: Maybe I should stop making people smell me. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting at a table, eating ice cream, and looking at the explosions on the Fist O' Pain]
Patrick: Want some?
SpongeBob: No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows.
Patrick: Yeah, that's the problem with this brand. I'll be right back. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Hurry back so we can go on the ride. [sees the roller coaster drop and plants his face in the table]
Ice Cream: [SpongeBob talks to himself, SpongeBob voices the ice cream] What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do.
Ice Cream: Patrick's your best friend. You can't let him down.
SpongeBob: I know, but the ride is really scary.
Ice Cream: You wanna see scary? I'll show you scary! [hits himself in the head with the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ice Cream: You like that? You like that? Huh, you like that? [cut to the bathroom where Patrick is talking to himself in the mirror]
Patrick: It's just a ride. What are you so scared about? You can do it.
Reflection: No you can't. You're a big crybaby.
Patrick: Oh, yeah? [punches his reflection, without breaking the glass] I thought we'd settled this the last time! [cut to SpongeBob still hitting himself in the head with the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!
Patrick: [runs back] SpongeBob, I have to tell you something.
SpongeBob: I have to tell you something too, Patrick.
Henry: [over speaker] Attention. Glove World! will be closing in five minutes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Five minutes?! [both run over to the ride. An employee comes over and cleans up the ice cream]
Ice Cream: What are you looking at? [cut to the ride]
SpongeBob: [reads the sign] Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas...
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: ...and explosive diarrhea. [explosion is heard]
SpongeBob: Is that all?
Patrick: Big deal, I did half that stuff this morning.
Henry: [over speaker] Last call for the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
SpongeBob: Well, this is it, Pat.
Patrick: Yep.
Patrick: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
Patrick: After you. [both sit down in the ride]
SpongeBob: We made it.
Patrick: Yeah.
Employee #3: Please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times. [buckles them, puts on helmets, and wraps them up] There.
Employee #4: Now if you could just sign this release, involving Glove World! in case of accidental spine loss... [SpongeBob signs his name] Well, nice knowing you.
Employee #3: Ready in ten...
SpongeBob: This is it, Patrick.
Employee #3: Nine, eight...
SpongeBob: We made it!
Employee #3: Seven, six...
Patrick: We're not scaredy cats.
Employee #3: Five, four...
SpongeBob: We're not crybabies.
Employee #3: Three, two...
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We're brave!
Employee #3: One... [when he presses the 'GO' button, SpongeBob and Patrick scream, but the roller coaster breaks down]
Henry: [over speaker] Uh, we're experiencing some technical difficulties.
Employee #3: Man, this cheap thing is always breaking down. Hey, sorry, guys. Maybe next time. [SpongeBob and Patrick sigh in relief]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.
Patrick: Me too.
SpongeBob: I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.
Patrick: I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
SpongeBob: But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.
Patrick: Yeah! [employee comes back]
Employee #3: Oh, wait, it's fine.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Huh?
Employee #3: Have fun. [presses the 'GO' button again. SpongeBob and Patrick take off but their wrapping and helmets have come off]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them! [when they get to the top, it stops for a moment] Goodbye, Patrick.
Patrick: Goodbye, SpongeBob. [Coaster starts again, dropping and going through a saw, a flaming fist, and a laser. When the coaster drops at a 90 degree angle, SpongeBob and Patrick's skeletons fly through the air while their bodies go down with the coaster. Their skeletons fly into them as they go up, out of the water, but when they sit up, they have the other one's skeleton. The coaster drops into the ground, causing an explosion. When the ride is over, SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are holding each other, shaking]
Woman: [over speaker] Please wait until the car has come to a complete stop. And stop crying!
Employee #3: It's over. You can get out now.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We did it! [both get out and run around in circles]
SpongeBob: We conquered our fears!
Patrick: We stopped crying!
SpongeBob: We survived the Fist o' Pain!
Employee #3: Hey, hold it right there! You forgot these.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Our spines! [grab their spines] Yeah! [when they grab them, they start to wiggle their bodies and then bend them backwards. They laugh]
SpongeBob: Let's go again!
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: ♪Someday, I'm going to make you sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly.♪ Drum solo! [uses spatula as drum sticks] ♪Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga—doo. Doo, doo, doo, Doo. Doo!♪ Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done. [flips all the patties into the air then uses one of his special helmet gadgets to squirt ketchup and mustard on the patties. When the patties fall, they land on a bun that SpongeBob is holding. He then deals out the lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes as if they were cards to the six patties] In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen a group of patties. Especially— you. [points to a patty with lettuce for hair, tomatoes for eyes, a pickle for a nose, ketchup for rosy cheeks and mustard for a smile] Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need that order of six.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six. [only gives Squidward five patties] That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything. [laughs]
Squidward: Uh— yeah.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: "That which is fried, must be eaten."
Squidward: SpongeBob, where is that other— oh, there it is. [takes the patty to the table. SpongeBob looks out the kitchen door to see three muscular guys sitting at the table, in which two of them are eating patties while the other one doesn't have one]
Muscular Guy #1: [being impatient for the patty] Where's my Krabby Patty?
Squidward: Right here, muscleboy.
Muscular Guy #1: It's about time. [before he takes a bite, the patty sheds a tear]
SpongeBob: [screams and grabs the patty] No, I won't let you do this to Patty.
Squidward: SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby—
SpongeBob: [sitting under the grill] Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved. [opens up the patty] Amazing.
Squidward: [snickering] What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it? [continues snickering]
SpongeBob: Great idea. [runs off]
Squidward: [sighs] I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.
SpongeBob: [gives a Krabby Patty to Muscular Guy #1] Enjoy, sir.
Muscular Guy #1: Can I eat this one? [lifts the top bun up off to reveal a familiar black leather shoe in the Patty] What....? Hey, how'd they know? I loved grilled shoe. [cut to SpongeBob's house where Patty is cooking on the grill]
SpongeBob: What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us. [small explosion] Fire! [alarm bell rings. SpongeBob pants] Fire! Fire!
Gary: [by a fire extinguisher] Meow. [puts out the fire. SpongeBob stops panting]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now. [doorbell rings] Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell. [opens the door]
Patrick: [lifts SpongeBob up] SpongeBob, how about another game of— [ties SpongeBob in a knot] tie your best buddy in knots. [lies down] My turn.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. [unties himself] I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops door open] Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did you?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready.
Sandy: Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eating, SpongeBob. Not for bebopping all over Timbuktu.
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that. [walks away] Patty and I have to be on our way.
Patrick: I've been replaced by a sandwich! [sobs] Maybe I could meet a lovely sandwich of my own. Yeah, that'll show SpongeBob. [walks away. cut to SpongeBob dancing with his patty and singing]
SpongeBob: ♪Oh, baby. They may call me a fool. But I can't help our gravitational pull. When I stuff you with cotton candy, it reminds me you're so sweet. When we go riding, it's dandy. The way you hang onto that seat. Ba-ay-ay-by.♪ [they feed the scallops some bread] ♪When I'm with you, Our love is stronger than glue. Oh, baby! There isn't anything. There's nothing in the world, I wouldn't do for you—♪ [SpongeBob sees Patty gone and is being surrounded by scallops] Hey, let go of her, you Patty-eaters! No! Get away! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! [he is using karate to break the scallops] Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Yah! Yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hiiiiyah! Patty, you okay, sweetums? ♪I'm so— sorry! I'll never let you out of my sight again. And I'll always keep you out of harm's way—♪ [SpongeBob is rowing a boat] ♪Oh, baby. Our love is so strong. That's why I'm singing this song. Ba-ay-ay-by. Your looks are sweeter than honey. From your pickles to your buns. It ain't even funny—!♪ [they fall off of a waterfall and into the river. Races for the patty] I'm coming for you! [he lifts her sunhat in which floats in the water and all her ingredients are spilled everywhere] Oh, no! Look at you! Don't worry, Patty! I'll take care of this! [he puts her back together but the patty is soggy] There you go! ♪All better— Oh, baby!♪ [cut to SpongeBob and Patty on a picnic. Patty has become rotten] Oh, Patty. Do you realize what this signifies? Mm-hmm. That's right. It's our six-hour anniversary. And do you know what that means? Are you all right, Patty? You don't seem so hot. Don't worry, I know what'll make you feel better. A dinner at the finest restaurant in Bikini Bottom. [cut to The Krusty Krab at an early evening with a pink sunset]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Where the barnacles is our fry cook? He's been gone all day. That boy's never been a work shirker. We got a crowd of hungry customers waiting.
Squidward: How should I know? Do I look like my idiot's keeper?
Mr. Krabs: Well— actually— [doors open to SpongeBob in a tux]
SpongeBob: Good day, sir.
Squidward: As if on cue.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's with the fancy getup?
SpongeBob: Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date.
Mr. Krabs: A dinner date? Well, blow me down, boy. I didn't know you had it in you. so when do we get to meet the little lady? [quietly] By the way, is she rich?
SpongeBob: She's rich in taste.
Squidward: How could you possibly date anyone? I mean, look at you. She must be blind. [limousine arrives]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, a limousine.
SpongeBob: There she is.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can smell the money already.
SpongeBob: [carrying in Patty] Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town. [walks by a couple eating and they sniff the odor in the air]
Martha Smith: Harold, again?
Harold Smith: Martha, I know what you're thinking. It's not me this time.
Martha Smith: Well, whatever it is, it's disgusting.
Harold Smith: Let's get out of here. [they walk away]
Martha Smith: Yuck.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Your date's a...Krabby Patty? [to Squidward] Methinks the boy's really lost it.
Squidward: [sniffs the odor and wafts the air] What's that putrid odor?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Oh, it's that Krabby Patty. [the patty is messy as a foghorn blows] What are you doing with that rotten piece of meat, boy?
SpongeBob: This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty. [quietly] And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the "manager's treatment," do you?
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, boy. no can do.
SpongeBob: Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different. [shows a $5 bill]
Mr. Krabs: What was that? I couldn't hear you.
SpongeBob: [gets out more money] How about now?
Mr. Krabs: All right, take a seat. [takes the money]
SpongeBob: Grrrrrazie! [gets out a tiny throne seat for Patty] Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen. [Squidward shows up. Speaks with a French accent] Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?
Squidward: Well, you should know considering the fact you work here, sod for brains. Speaking of sods— why don't you get rid of this garbage? It's starting to stink up the joint.
SpongeBob: Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie.
Squidward: I'll show you sick. [grabs the patty]
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?
Squidward: Beautiful, huh? How beautiful do you think this is? [patty has maggots in it and is gross]
SpongeBob: [takes patty from Squidward] Stop it, Squidward! Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea.
Squidward: Well, I definitely see I can't help the mentally atrophied. Goodbye, Creature.
SpongeBob: Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you— [sniffs] Yeah, what is that smell? [gasps] Patty? [the patty looks the same way it was before when SpongeBob showed Mr. Krabs and Squidward. Screams as he drops the Krabby Patty on the table] What happened to you?
Mr. Krabs: I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does. [rotten tomatoes fall out of the patty] Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So— I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?
SpongeBob: Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due.
SpongeBob: I see now. I see what I must do. [jumps up on the table] Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love. [the sickness rumbles. Eats it]
Mr. Krabs: Well done, boy. As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25¢ for the patty. Employee discount.
SpongeBob: [starts to puke] Can I get a doggie bag with that?
Squidward: Well, Squidward, ol' boy, all that's left is to go win that dancing trophy and give it a home. After all, nobody ever worked harder to get it than you. [flashback to him dancing with some other fish] All those years of training with the masters. Your tireless effort to keep your instrument supple. [flashback to him getting his legs twisted and stretched] Not to mention your weekly thigh waxing. [pulls some hair off his leg as a scream is heard] And now, it's time to go get it. So, let's do it. Whoo...! [runs out of his house and into a bar of bamboo]
Patrick: Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Want to give me a ruling, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.
Squidward: What? What are you two doing?
SpongeBob: We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.
Patrick: We're gonna win the trophy.
Squidward: Ha. The two of you? Don't make me laugh. Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going. [shows them the trophy case]
SpongeBob: You built us a trophy case for when we win? [both hug Squidward] Oh, you are a true friend.
Squidward: no, you twits. I built that trophy case for me when I win. I'm going to ace the tryouts today and then I'm going to the finals tomorrow and win the trophy. I am going forth to meet my destiny. Good-bye. [runs out but runs into the limbo bar again]
Patrick: Ruling, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I think we better raise the bar. [cut to the tryouts where Squidward sits down on the bench]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Hiya, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, great. The flying Gyvonne Brothers. Just ignore them, Squidward.
Female: [over loudspeaker] Contestants 51 and 52 to the stage, please.
SpongeBob: We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward.
Squidward: Do I know you?
SpongeBob: [laughs] You kidder. Let's go, Patrick.
Squidward: Poor boobs, they don't stand a chance. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward.
Squidward: You actually got in?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Squidward: Humph, if those two nitwits made it then I'm a shoo-in.
Female: [over loudspeaker] Contestant 53 to the stage, please.
Squidward: Look out, dancing world, here comes your future. Music, please. [dances]
Judge: Next.
Squidward: Excuse me?
Judge: You're done. You know, next contestant. You didn't make the cut, sorry, Mac.
Squidward: But, but, but, but, you don't understand. I already build a trophy case with the cutest little plaque. If I could just touch it...
Judge: Hey!
Squidward: But I, hey... Unhand me, you brutes. Ah! [cut to Squidward crying into his house and walking into a limbo bar again]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.
Squidward: Doh, help me up.
SpongeBob: How'd the audition go, Squidward?
Squidward: (gets choked up)The audition? My trophy? [sobs uncontrollably] I mean, uh, uh, yeah, the audition. [chuckles] Evidently, I'm such a great dancer that I've been banned from the competition for life.
Patrick: Whoa.
SpongeBob: Impressive. [gasps] Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?
Squidward: What? I've got better thinks to do than help you two dopes.
Patrick: Like polishing your empty trophy case?
Squidward: Fine. But I keep the trophy when we win, deal?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Deal.
Squidward: Ok. Show me what you got, Patrick.
Patrick: Ok, here I go. Watch me now. [goes under the limbo stick but gets a butt cramp before going all the way through] Cramp! [screams and rolls around. Squidward opens the door and Patrick rolls outside]
Squidward: Well, I guess that just leaves you, SpongeBob. Show me your stuff. Ready, and... [turns on some music. SpongeBob laughs and wiggles his arms and legs all around the room. Squidward grabs his arms] Having fun?
SpongeBob: Yes, yes I am.
Squidward: SpongeBob, dancing isn't supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be art and art is suffering! Now, we'll start with some ballet. Watch my feet and follow my lead. Ready, and...plié. [SpongeBob and Squidward bend their knees] Relevé. [twirl around on their toes] And now grand jeté. [Squidward slips on the limbo stick] Where am I? See if I can find the lights. [turns on the light and sees a giant SpongeBob face. Squidward's head is stuck inside SpongeBob's body] Wait a minute. [feels around] This gives me an idea. [Squidward's body is now inside SpongeBob's] Ready, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [salutes] Ready!
Squidward: A one and a two, and... [SpongeBob dances] Plié, jeté, relevé - [SpongeBob's legs get tangled in a knot] No, no, no. This will never work. You've got two left feet.
SpongeBob: [takes off feet] How'd you know? [he wiggles both of his left pair of toes]
Squidward: Gimme those. [takes SpongeBob's legs and puts his own legs through SpongeBob's pants] That's better. Ok, let's go. SpongeBob, what are you doing? [SpongeBob's arms are in the air wiggling] Why are you moving your arms like that?
SpongeBob: [laughs] I guess they're happy.
Squidward: Argh, hand 'em over. [SpongeBob hands Squidward one of his arms] And the other one, come on. [Squidward breaks off the other one then uses his arms as SpongeBob's] Ah, now that's more like it.
SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.
Squidward: Are you questioning my leadership.
SpongeBob: Well, I just...
Squidward: Ok, hand it over. [SpongeBob hands his mouth to Squidward]
SpongeBob: You know what, Squidward?
Squidward: What's that?
SpongeBob: I think I'm suffering for my art now. [cut to the dance recital where Pilar is already dancing] Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.
Squidward: Oh, please. Just wait until you see my brilliant moves.
[Pilar who is dancing falls on his face. The crowd gasps as the judges give him a total score of 5. The next dancer is a whale balancing a ball on its head. The judges total score is 23.5. The next dancer is a giant sea horse, then a dancer who can balance coins on his arms while jumping up and down. The judges score him a 29.5]
SpongeBob: Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent.
Squidward: Quit groveling. Where is your dignity? [gets SpongeBob up and slaps him] These losers are here to worship us. I mean me. By the end of the night I'll have them on their knees just begging for more.
Female: [over loudspeaker] Now that's what I like to call a hard act to follow. Next up, we have SpongeBob SquarePants.
Frank: Oh, man. I can't wait. I am so stoked on dancing right now.
SpongeBob: Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight. [Squidward grabs SpongeBob's mouth]
Squidward: Will you stop it? And let my dancing do the talking. [dances]
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent.
Squidward: Of course they have. They are in the presence of a true artiste.
Frank: What's he doing?
Nat: Is he hurt?
Nathiel: I don't know man, but it's hurting my eyes.
Clay: I think I'm gonna be sick. [throws up]
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward?
Squidward: Ha. If they think that's good, wait till they see... [gets a knot in his leg] Cramp! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! [bounces around on the floor on his headwhile everyone leaves. Fred was asleep wakes up and is about to walk out the door. All grumbling and leaving, except blue man]
Fred: Hey, guys, wait up. Huh? What's this? [sees SpongeBob dancing] That's kind of nice. Hey guys, come check this out.
Squidward: Must finish dance... on other... [gets another cramp in the other leg]
SpongeBob: Um, Squidward, is this part of the act?
Squidward: [screams] I'm in pain! [crowd cheers and throws flower onto the stage]
Judge #2: By unanimous decision, we have a winner.
Squidward: [gasps] Mine! [grabs the trophy and hugs it] I won, I won!
Judge #2: Never before have I seen such zest, such joie de vivre.
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, you're too kind. But I couldn't have done it without a very special someone. [grabs Squidward]
Squidward: Wait, SpongeBob, no! [is pulled out from SpongeBob's body]
Judge #2: The rulebook clearly states "A single dancer must perform without any further assistance from a partner." Therefore, you're the winner. [hands trophy to coin balancing dancer]
Fish #6: Oh man, the jig's up, Pedro. We're going home. [rips his wig in half and shows Pedro inside of it]
Pedro: It's all right, I'll go call a taxi.
Judge #2: Merciful Neptune. Are there any more cheaters?
Fish #7: [takes off the sea horse costume] Ah, crud, we're two dancers.
Scottish Octopus: We're nine dancers, actually. [lifts his kilt up to show 8 little ones around his legs]
Pilar: [takes Frank out of his pants] Does this count?
Judge #2: Isn't there a single dancer here who is not assisted by a partner?
Judge: Uh, what about number 52 over there? [Patrick is moving around on the ground screaming]
Judge #2: Is he alone?
Judge: Well, let me see. [looks inside Patrick's mouth] Why, yes, he is a single dancer.
Judge #2: Oh, well, then. I guess he wins. [Patrick screams some more as everyone else, except Squidward cheers]
SpongeBob: I love your new dance, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks.
Narrator: Epilogue.
Sadie: Tommy? I've got a fresh load of laundr- [screams as she thinks Tommy is having a seizure on the floor] Tommy! Oh! Oh, dear me, no! [dials phone numbers] Hello, it's an emergency! My son! He's-
Tommy: [scoffs] Mom, calm down. [stops music] I'm just doing "The Cramp"!
Sadie: [hangs up phone] Oh, oh you kids and your crazy dance fads. [she laughs and is soon joined by Mr Krabs, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward]
Patrick: Hey, everybody, let's all do "the cramp"!
All: Yeah! [Sadie sets up the music. Everybody dances "the cramp" and scream]
Squidward: Okay, would you like any fries with that?
Customer #1: Uh, [turns around to the other customers] Hey, if I get some kelp fries, would you guys share them with me?
Jimmy: Do we know you?
Customer #1: [turns back to Squidward] Two orders of kelp fries, please.
Squidward: And two orders of—
Customer #1: I only said one order.
Squidward: But you said "two."
Customer #1: Okay, I'll have two.
Squidward: [takes out a ticket for the customers' order] SpongeBob, order up. [all the tickets are stuck in the window, he sighs] Welcome to The Krusty— [all the tickets get shot out and Squidward walks in the kitchen] SpongeBob, what in Neptune's... [sees that SpongeBob's body can't move] SpongeBob? [pushes him back and forth and hat tips over. touches spatula] Well, his spatula's still warm. [pokes his eye] Well, SpongeBob. I must admit this is strange behavior, even for you.
Mr. Krabs: [shows up in the kitchen] Ahoy, Squidward. [sees SpongeBob] Good Neptune, SpongeBob. What has gotten into to you, son?
Squidward: I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance.
Mr. Krabs: No, Squidward. This is worse. he's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once meself back in me service days. [shakes SpongeBob] What is it, lad? Quick, we're losing money! [SpongeBob's hat falls off and Mr. Krabs picks up what's in it] It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he has circled today's date. [reads the date on the 23rd] "Important Food Critic visits Krusty Krab?!"
Squidward: That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say. [both Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are quivering] I rest my case. [the doors get pushed away and a fish version of Gene Shalit named "Gene Scallop" enters and sniffs the air in the restaurant] Hey, in or out, mister? You're letting out the A.C. [the fish stares at Squidward] Weirdo.
Mr. Krabs: Why, hello! You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't ya? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine... [Gene Scallop walks away and up to Squidward]
Squidward: Well, do you want to order something or do you just want to block my reading light?
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop! Don't you know our lives depend on his review?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, the only thing my life depends on is going home at 6:00. [Mr. Krabs walks over to Gene Scallop]
Mr. Krabs: M— Mr. Scallop, wait, please! Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. It's absolutely— [spits while trying to say "free"] Complimentary. [cut to SpongeBob squirting mustard on Mr. Scallop's patty, then putting the bun on] Okay, SpongeBob, that'll be all. [SpongeBob lifts up his hat, then puts it back down and leaves] He's nobody. [Gene takes the Krabby Patty and takes one bite, then leaves without saying a word] We're doomed! [cut to news on the TV as cats meow]
Barbara: And there were no survivors.
Bob: Thank you, Barbara.
Barbara: Thank you, Bob.
Squidward: She is so tacky.
Bob: And now it's time for "Bottom Feeding" with Gene Scallop.
Mr. Krabs: Turn it up, Squidward. [Squidward turns it up]
Gene Scallop: Thank you, Bob. This week, I visited--
Bob: You're welcome, Gene.
Gene Scallop: [clears throat and moves his glasses] This week, I reviewed The Krusty Krab restaurant, a local burger joint that's second to none; or should I say second to "run," since this critic wanted to make like a banana and peel out the minute he saw how drab this Krab really was.
Barbara: That bad, huh, Gene?
Gene Scallop: Barbara, once I stuck my beak through that door, my appetite flew South for the winter. I mean, I'm not "kidding" when I say this restaurant smells like the rear-end of a goat. [customers smell the aroma, and a gas noise is heard]
Bob: And how was the service, Gene?
Gene Scallop: You could find livelier help in a graveyard and I'm not just "coffin." [two customers are whispering to each other] The management stunk so bad, I had to get my sweater dry cleaned on the way home... with me in it. [customers start mumbling and walking out]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, no, wait! Wait!
Gene Scallop: [too close to Barbara and Bob] However, at the end of my visit, I chowed down on a meal that titillated my taste buds and gratified my gullet. That sponge behind the grill is no square when it comes to cooking. [excited talking as the customers rush to sit down at their tables for some food] If Krabs really wanted to soak up the dough, he'd sponge it up, he'd sponge it out, he'd over-sponge it. You can never have too much sponge. [Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Well, back to work.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] That's me boy, SpongeBob! That's me boy. [SpongeBob walks in the kitchen as a dollar sign while register rings keep sounding. Cut to a line of fish lined up at The Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow. [Mr. Krabs is working on putting a new sign called "The Krusty Sponge"]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, a little lower, lower— that's perfect!
SpongeBob: Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes.
SpongeBob: Oh, you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his—
Mr. Krabs: [cuts him off before he could finish]Umm— yeah, a little bit like that. [cut to inside of the Krusty Sponge where SpongeBob walks past Squidward, dressed in a SpongeBob costume with a sign behind saying "As Seen on TV"]
SpongeBob: Morning, Squidward! [oblivious to the costume] Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes? [Squidward hisses at SpongeBob who runs away]
Tyler: Look, it's him! [walks up to Squidward] Mr. SquarePants, can I have your autograph?
Squidward: No.
Tyler: But, why?
Squidward: Well, the first reason is, I have no use of my arms. See? [shakes his arms, but accidentally hits Tyler]
Tyler: Ow![Mr. Krabs runs between them.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's going on over here?
Tyler: He hit me, just as I wanted his autograph!
Mr. Krabs: [Angry]Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph— for five bucks.
Tyler: What a rip! [walks away. Grumbles madly, goes to a table]
Mr. Krabs: Look at these, Squidward! [holds up napkins that have SpongeBob's face on them]
Squidward: Looks like some horrific shroud.
Mr. Krabs: They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent. [laughs]
Squidward: You really need to see a doctor.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes. [points to a stack of boxes that say "KK" on them]
Squidward: What's in them?
Mr. Krabs: [takes out two bottles that have SpongeBob's face as a label and red nozzles] Condiments. We got "Tangy Spongy Sauce" and "Mild Bobby Sauce" for the not-so-daring.
Squidward: Oh, clever. [SpongeBob runs up to Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!
Mr. Krabs: I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward. [sticks it into the costume's forehead] You're on grill duty now.
Squidward: But that's SpongeBob's job!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him. [cut to SpongeBob as the engineer in the train that is going around The Krusty Krab] Step right up, folks! Take a ride on The Krusty Sponge Fun Train! Tickets are only $1.98. Seat belts not included. [everyone cheers. Cut to the kitchen, where Squidward is looking at the spatula that is on the grill]
Squidward: Okay, how am I going to do this now? Umm— [grunts while trying to get the spatula. Hits it with one of the costume arms and hits himself in the forehead, sending him back into pots and pans] Mommy, is that you? [outside, SpongeBob is tired of pedaling the train]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I really think I should be getting back to the grill now.
Mr. Krabs: Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers! [uses the megaphone] Who's ready for another lap? [everyone cheers] Keep on truckin', SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office. [cut to Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, entering Mr. Krabs' office]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it? [Mr. Krabs is bathing in his money]
Mr. Krabs: [Nervously]No!
Squidward: Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign.
Mr. Krabs: [Still nervous]Okay, tell them I'll be right out.
Squidward: Got it. [as he turns around, he hits his head on the top of the door entrance] Ow! [mutters]
Mr. Krabs: And let's watch the language, Squidward! [cut to Mr. Krabs signing for the packages]
Joe: Just sign here, here and here.
Mr. Krabs: My pleasure.
Squidward: What the heck is all this stuff?
Mr. Krabs: I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws— [shows a green straw with SpongeBob in the middle] coasters— [holds up two coasters with SpongeBob's face on them] bibs— [holds up a bib with SpongeBob's face on it that says "I soiled myself at The Krusty Sponge"] and me personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes! [shows them, but they melt away] Aww.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?
Mr. Krabs: [Showing signs of delusion] Get back to work, SpongeBob! I'll be in me SpongeBob if you SpongeBob me. [walks away crazily as Squidward is not surprised. Cut to Squidward flipping a patty and laughing at his success] Whoops! [sets three boxes down on the floor] There you go, Squidward.
Squidward: Now what?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you're going to love this. Spongy Patties! [shows a yellow patty with green holes]
Squidward: Spongy Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. I want you to start using them instead of the other ones. [tosses one on the grill]
Squidward: Where'd you get them?
Mr. Krabs: They were just the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know.[he chuckles]
Squidward: You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make them $2.98! [shuts the kitchen door. Cut to SpongeBob blowing the whistle on the Fun Train, but he’s really tired]
SpongeBob: All aboard...
Nat: Hey, we didn't pay $3.00 to watch you take a nap!
Sadie: That's the worst SpongeBob costume I've ever seen! [all the passengers chant] Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride! [SpongeBob sneaks away and takes the statue of himself, where Billy is going to get a picture by a camera by Harold, and puts it in his seat of the Fun Train, then squeezes through the doors of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. What a day. What's next? A zombie invasion? [screams seeing after Buddy, Bill, Tina, Sadie, Sandals and Frank with yellow skin and green spots similar to SpongeBob's holes walking around like zombies] Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me!
Mr. Krabs: Uh, go away, please, I'm busy.
SpongeBob: Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies! [screams as the zombies walk towards him] Open up, open up, open up! [bangs on the door hard enough to where it collapses on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: Who? [Mr. Krabs is dressed in a nice shirt with a pile of money in the chair across from him]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob— [sees the zombies and gasps] Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies— they're here to eat me money! [tries to run back into his office, but SpongeBob grabs him and turns him around]
SpongeBob: Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look! [two fish are sitting at the table. One is yellow with green spots and the other one is normal-looking]
Sandals: [groans] I ate this yellow Krabby Patty and now I feel sick.
Bailiff: Krabby Patty? [takes a bite and spits it out, disgusted. He then glares at the worried Mr. Krabs before he walks up to him ] Man, you've got some serious problems. If you're trying to pass that off as a Krabby Patty—
Mr. Krabs: [Nervously]It's a... It's a Spongy Patty! [Bailiff turns yellow with green spots]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what have you done?! You've poisoned all these people!
Mr. Krabs: [Shocked and guilty]No! But... I just... just... I can explain, I... [Mr. Krabs looks down at his wrists because they are in handcuffs] What the...?
Bailiff: [shows his police badge] Tell it to the judge, Krabs. [cut to the courtroom]
Guard: Calling the courtroom to attention in the case "People of Bikini Bottom vs. Mr. Krabs." The honorable Judge Horace A. Whopper presiding.
Judge Horace A. Whopper: [clears throat] Has the jury reached a verdict? [jury is all yellow with green spots. Gene Scallop stands up and is yellow with green spots, too]
Gene Scallop: [along with angry fish, except Tina who is not angry] We have, your honor. We the jury find the defendant, Eugene H. Krabs, guilty of all charges.
Judge Horace A. Whopper: Very well. Does the defendant have anything to say before we send him down the river?
Mr. Krabs: [sadly] No, your honor.
Judge Horace A. Whopper: Very well. [bangs the SpongeBob gavel down. When he does, it laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Eh, hang on a second there, judge! That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?
Judge Horace A. Whopper: Oh, why, yes. It's my prized possession. I am a huge SpongeBob fan.
Mr. Krabs: Permission to approach the bench, your honor! [cut to a patty being flipped on the grill]
SpongeBob: Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position. [outside, Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, is giving the judge a ride on the Fun Train. The judge has a whip in his hand] Take him around as many times as you like.
Judge Horace A. Whopper: I just might have to take you up on that. [winks and cracks his whip so Squidward goes faster]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] I love a happy ending. [laughs]
[screen goes blank as the whip cracks at the background]
Patrick: [reading a comic book. Screams] No, no! [starts crying then stops] Yay! [laughs]
Nerd: Well, if only inaudible lad were here right now.
Patrick: Oh. [eats comic book] Nothing satisfies like a good story.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Patrick with a stack of comic books] Are ya ready to go, Patrick?
Patrick: [screams] Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you!
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me!
Patrick: Sponge-- [burps and a piece of paper lands into SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Ew, what's this?
Patrick: [takes the piece of paper] Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it! [inspects the piece of paper and gasps] SpongeBob, what do all these words say?
SpongeBob: It's an ad. [talks in an announcer tone] Dear Comic Book Reader.
Patrick: That's me!
SpongeBob: [continues as announcer] Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
Patrick: I never thought about anything!
SpongeBob: [continues] Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit! [uses regular tone of voice again] Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
Patrick: I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!
SpongeBob: You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all! [makes a disgusted face] Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100. [SpongeBob's wallet falls out of his and struggles to pick it up] Patrick, could you get my wallet? [Patrick picks up SpongeBob's wallet]
Patrick: Hey, look. [pulls out $100 bill from wallet] I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my comic book money!
Patrick: [indignant] It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Patrick. [the comic book store clerk shows up]
Comic Book Store Clerk: Hey, you going to pay for those comics? [SpongeBob's arms fall off with the comics]
SpongeBob: No. [gets kicked out] Ow! Can I have my arms back? [cut to SpongeBob's house]
Patrick: I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Good luck. [doorbell rings] Coming-- [Patrick slams door against SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work? [cut to Patrick at the desk]
Patrick: [hovering the pencil over the paper] SpongeBob! THIS PENCIL IS BROKEN! Why won't it make words?
SpongeBob: You have to think of the words yourself. [walks away with the laundry]
Patrick: I think I wrote a poem once. [flashback to Patrick's childhood]
Young Patrick: A poem, by Patrick Star. Roses are blue, violets are red, I have to go to the bathroom. [eats his poem and then burps and takes a bow]
Gym Teacher: How many times do I gotta tell ya, this is gym class! [blows whistle and everyone starts throwing dodgeballs at Patrick, who takes cover]
Patrick: [present time] Ohh, dodgeballs.
SpongeBob: [shadow figure of himself holding a dodgeball and wearing an evil grin] Oh, Patrick!
Patrick: [screams] Don't hit me with a dodgeball! [hides under the desk and SpongeBob turns on the lights and Gary pops out of his shell]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
Patrick: I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once.
SpongeBob: [gets shocked] No!
Patrick: Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball! [starts crying] Whyyyyyy?! [dramatic music plays]
SpongeBob: [stops Gary's record player] You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?
Patrick: I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs.
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?
Gary: [saying no suspiciously] Meow.
Patrick: If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain.
SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window. [cut to SpongeBob's house with an opened window with Patrick struggling to write the poem]
Patrick: [tapping his head with the pencil] Come on, you stupid brain! work! [Patrick's brain starts working and smoke comes out] It's working! [struggling as he starts writing]
SpongeBob: [knocking] Patrick, don't strain yourself. [Patrick continues struggling as Squidward opens the window]
Squidward: Now, what's going on? [looks disgusted] What is that horrible smell? [SpongeBob comes out] Is Patrick thinking again?
Patrick: I'm making art!
Squidward: Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died.
Patrick: That's the creative process at work! [Squidward closes the window] Ready to go to the post office? [shows a letter with his poem in it] I need to mail in my masterpiece.

SpongeBob: I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work.
Patrick: Yeah! And me too! Now sit down and get comfortable.
SpongeBob: [sits on his arm chair, while Patrick pushes a big stereo in front of him] Uh, Patrick?
Patrick: [on top of the stereo] SpongeBob SquarePants! Are you ready to rock?! Whooo! [SpongeBob screams as Patrick lands on the chair and turns on the music]
SpongeBob: [covering his ears] It's really loud!
Patrick: You need it louder? Okay!
Lead singer: [singing Patrick's poem] ♪Twinkle, twinkle, Patrick Star. I made myself a sandwich. My mommy named it Fred. It tastes like beans and bacon. And smells like it's been dead.

Patrick: That was awesome! Did you like it or did you really, really like it? Give me your completely honest opinion of how great it was.
SpongeBob: [looking like he wants to insult it] Oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard!
Patrick: Do you really think so?
SpongeBob: We need to get that song on the radio!
Patrick: Then let's go right now, come on! [takes SpongeBob's arm off]

Patrick: I can't wait to see look on their face once they hear this. [they go inside and employee screams and kicks them out and closes the door]
SpongeBob: Did you see the look on his face?
Patrick: Yeah. Did you see his ears?
SpongeBob: I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio?
Patrick: What record? [they see the antenna]
SpongeBob: I got an idea! [cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof. Wind howls as SpongeBob and Patrick shiver] We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna.
Patrick: Carry me?
SpongeBob: Huh? Patrick-- [Patrick lands on top of SpongeBob and SpongeBob picks him up, struggling]
Patrick: Tally ho! Mush! Onward and upward! [SpongeBob is struggling to get to the top of the antenna] Faster, SpongeBob! Faster! [Patrick sees a satellite go by. They get to the top of the antenna. Patrick stands on SpongeBob's face, takes out his record player and then puts it on the top of the antenna, the record player wobbles and falls off and Patrick catches it] Oh! Hmm-- this record won't stay put.
SpongeBob: [mumbling inaudibly]
Patrick: Good idea. [takes out bubble gum and throws it in his mouth and chews on it, while making noises and he blows a bubble]

Squidward: It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned!
SpongeBob: Well, okay, you sit this one out, Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef. [talking to customer] For your dining pleasure, two double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love. [reaches into his chest and pulls out a heart and sprinkles some of it on the Krabby Patties. He then pants] Enjoy your meal! [sighs] It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it, Squidward?
Squidward: [breathes] Oh, yeah, you really touched his life. [cuts to scene of customer eating his Krabby Patties like a pig]
SpongeBob: Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes.
Squidward: Quality food?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Good people?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [nods]
Squidward: Discriminating tastes?
SpongeBob: Testify!
Squidward: D'oh! [breathes angrily, then runs up to customer then takes a Krabby Patty] Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage! [Squidward takes away a Krabby Patty, then the customer cries]
SpongeBob: Squidward! The Krusty clientèle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect. [takes Krabby Patty from Squidward and puts it in customers mouth like a baby bottle] There, there. [to Squidward] Mr. Krabs will be ashamed! [Mr. Krabs walks in]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you filthy bilge rats!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way! [goes around to the back of the Krusty Krab and starts tipping it and all the customers fall out and then puts it back and walks into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: What's happening, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy froufrou places, where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions!
Squidward: Fancy? Froufrou?
Mr. Krabs: We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Chef exchange program?
Mr. Krabs: [stops laughing] Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes! [bus arrives] Heh, looks like it's early. [kicks SpongeBob into the bus and it drives off]
Squidward: It was that easy? All these years? [sniffles] I've underestimated the power of public transportation! [another bus arrives with Le Schnook on it]
Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: Does your middle name happen to be "No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here"? [he and Mr. Krabs laugh]
Le Schnook: I find you disgusting. [they stop laughing] However, my culture dictates zat I must kiss you regardless. [kisses Squidward on each cheek, then spits twice before doing the same with Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy.
Squidward: But the surly attitude he has is a step in the right direction! [cuts to scene of the bus dropping off SpongeBob at the Fancy! restaurant. SpongeBob then walks into the kitchen]
Fancy Head Chef: What is this rubbish?! I would not wipe my own bottom with this! [slaps Archie who is holding a steak] Start over! And this [drinks boiled water, then spits it on Paco] I would not wash my own bottom with this after carefully wiping and wiping and wiping! [slaps Paco] Now go stand in the corner and think about what you have done! [Paco walks away sadly] And where is my exchange chef?! 
SpongeBob: Um, right here, sir.
Fancy Head Chef: [laughs] There you are. Bonjour! [kisses SpongeBob two times, SpongeBob giggles and the chief slaps him] Now, get to your station and prepare me your best dish! [SpongeBob runs to a pot, puts some ingredients into it, then takes out a Krabby Patty and blows a kiss and a heart shows up. The chef then grabs it and crushes it] This is not funny! And I certainly did not exchange my top sous chef for a, how you say, comedian! [puts Krabby Patty in SpongeBob's mouth and then pulls is nose causing him to eat it] Prepare me a gourmet dish, NOW! [SpongeBob runs over to a counter with vegetables on it]
SpongeBob: [starts chopping vegetables] I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than... [chops vegetables into a Krabby Patty then laughs nervously] Just warming up. [Chief gets angry, he then screams than gets a tray of stuff and puts in in the oven] Come on, SpongeBob! [whistles and then takes out a Krabby Patty and throws it on the ground, Chief gets angry again, he then cracks an egg into a pan] Just one egg then... [egg turns into a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob gets mad and throws it on the ground along with many other Krabby Patties] No, that's not it, no...
Fancy Head Chef: You are making a mockery of my... [Krabby Patty accidentally lands in his mouth and he eats it] This taste is fantastic! What do you call it? [he then eats another one]
SpongeBob: A Krabby Patty.
Fancy Head Chef: [is eating more Krabby Patties] The whole world must taste this!
Narrator: Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab... [We see that the Krusty Krab is all decorated fancy]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward, look at this! [holds up a plate with a small fruit on it] We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy. [laughs and then Squidward smells its horrible odor]
Squidward: Oh! What is that?!
Mr. Krabs: I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something.
Le Schnook: Wrong, monsieur! It is ze Rare Fruit of ze Kazook Tree.
Mr. Krabs: So it's supposed to smell like a rotten gym socks?
Le Schnook: Its naturally rancid odor can only be neutralized by shredded gold.
Mr. Krabs: Shredded... [gulps] gold? [Le Schnook then starts shredding gold with a cheese grater. Mr. Krabs screams and takes it away from him] Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?
Le Schnook: Price can be no object when it comes to dealing with exquisite food like zis. It must be prepared with only the finest ingredients, and eaten with only the finest silverware, while sitting on the finest furniture! [Le Schnook tries to sit in one of the chair, but it is just a billboard] Zis... is not ze chair I ordered...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, well you see those were out of stock.
Le Schnook: And zis fork of plastic... Spray painted to look silver, is it not? [Mr. Krabs starts to sweat, chuckling nervously. Le Schnook gets back up, dusting himself] I cannot prepare food UNDER ZESE CONDITIONS! [cuts back to the Fancy! restaurant where there is a big line and everybody is eating Krabby Patties]
Fancy Head Chief: Monsieur SpongeBob, although it is in direct violation of our chef exchange program rules, let me assure you that these kisses are not merely a formality. They are genuine! [kisses SpongeBob twice] I am sure that this is only the beginning of a long and... [SpongeBob's alarm on his wrist watch rings]
SpongeBob: Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again! [is about to walk out, but the chef stops him]
Fancy Head Chef: I apologize, Monsieur SpongeBob, but you can see that my customers had grown rather fond of your Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab! [starts taking all the Krabby Patties and putting them in a sack and then puts it in his suitcase] So long! [customers gasp and SpongeBob begins to leave and one customer holds on to his leg]
Customer: Wait, just one more?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, but I've got to go. [all customers hold on to his leg. However, he manages to get out. The scene switches to the Krusty Krab and it has a sign that reads “out of business” because it went bankrupt. Inside the restaurant, repo men are seen hauling away the fancy furniture. We then see Mr. Krabs crying in his office]
Mr. Krabs: I'm ruined! Busted! [phone then rings and Mr. Krabs answers it] Hello?
Pearl: [on phone] Daddy, the house is full of burglars. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men. [Mr. Krabs hangs up and notices Squidward being held on to by his arms by two other repo men]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!
Mr. Krabs: Uh, well, you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents.
Squidward: You sold me?!?
Mr. Krabs: No! Bartered is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps.
Repo Man: Come on, mac! [takes him away]
Squidward: You're pathetic! [Le Schnook then walks in]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now.
Le Schnook: Not quite. My time in the chef's exchange program has expired. So my "eats" and I are leaving. [hands Mr. Krabs a bill] This is for you.
Mr. Krabs: Is it money?
Le Schnook: It is the bill for my services. [Mr. Krabs unfolds the bill. His eyes become bloodshot, and he is unable to move]
Repo Man: One side, please. [Repo men take Mr. Krabs’ desk and chair away while he is sitting in it, a repo man brings Mr. Krabs back into the restaurant lobby. He is set down on the floor. Mr. Krabs starts crying]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can still hear his sweet little voice.
SpongeBob: [High pitched] Mr. Kra-a-abs?!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, now I'm scared.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Darn his cursed mocking voice! I... [notices SpongeBob] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy. You came back! And you brought customers!
[The scene cuts to all customers talking at once. We can hear some of them. Customer #1 says: "Oh, please, we must have some Krabby Patties. We just adore...". Customer #2 says: "Please, Krabby Patties...". Customer #3 says: "Krabby Patties, please.". Customer #4 says: "Krabby Patties..."]
Mr. Krabs: [now talking to Squidward] Well, Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old clientèle back, and rich disgusting new clientèle to boot! [Rich woman burps] I'm back in business!
Squidward: Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, froufrou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey, get back you, eat your own. [Mr. Krabs throws them a bucket of Krabby Patties, the customers squeal like pigs] Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs. [Blows another kiss, Squidward swallows it and starts choking. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh]
Squidward: [Wakes up, jumps into the shower, and starts to brush himself when he starts hearing a slide whistling noise every time he moves the brush] Huh? What's that? Hmm, must be hearing things.
[Goes outside and breathes in]
Squidward: Ahhhh... smell that fresh morning sea! [Singing to himself] ♪La da dum dum dee.♪
[Bends down to pick up the newspaper and hears the slide whistling noise. The same happens when he stands back up]
Squidward: Huh? Must be hearing things... Again!
[Slide whistling noises happen when he shakes the bag and when the newspaper slides out]
Squidward: [Breathes out. hears the slide whistle] What is that noise?!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing]
Squidward: Ahhhh.... I should have guessed. It's too early for this.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing again]
Squidward: Alright, you two! [SpongeBob and Patrick are seen as lumps under Squidward's front mat. He stomps on the lumps] What is the meaning of this?!
[Squidward lifts up the mat]
SpongeBob: What is the meaning of this?! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. They stand up with the slide whistle effect] We're slide whistling!
Squidward: Don't you mean, "Playing the slide whistle?"
SpongeBob: Squidward, slide whistling is more than just simply tooting on an instrument! It's a way of life! Let's show him Patrick.
[Squidward's door opens with the slide whistling effect. SpongeBob and Patrick run inside]
Squidward: Hey! Get out of here! Huh? [Squidward looks around and doesn't see them. SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing]
Squidward: Alright, you two morons! Show yourselves!
[They slide out from the dining room light with the slide whistle effect]
SpongeBob: You see, Squidward! Slide whistling can add a little zest to the humdrum of everyday life.
Squidward: I don't need zest! I need you out of my lampshade! [Squidward jumps onto the table to get them out but they're not there. SpongeBob appears with the slide whistle effect behind a plant]
Squidward: Get out of there!
[SpongeBob floats through the air with the slide whistle noise and out the door]
Squidward: Grrrrr... [SpongeBob and Patrick are spinning around the circular windows] Just get out of there! [They land onto Squidward's paintings. as the shape of Squidward's head] Okay, that's enough! You've had your fun.
SpongeBob: True, Squidward, true. We have had our fun. But you know what's twice as much fun?! [Pops out of the painting] Twice as many slide whistles! After you, my good man. [hands Patrick a slide whistle]
Patrick: Thanks, buddy! [Patrick floats out of the painting and across the room. SpongeBob follows. They start to head toward the windows]
Squidward: Not the windows again! [Runs to the window and opens it] Gotcha! They're gone. Whew! Now if they'd just stay out of my house, I might be able to enjoy a little squid time.
[Squidward makes himself a pot of tea.. The slide whistle effect happens when he pours the tea into the cup.. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. Squidward closes the blinds and then sits down to drink his tea. The slide whistle effect is also here.. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh outside.. SpongeBob and Patrick continue this when Squidward is making his bed, when he brushes his teeth, cleans the toilet, and reads]
Squidward: [getting angry, about to explode] I gotta get out of here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing when Squidward walks through the door, shattering it]
SpongeBob: Look Patrick! Squidward is finally playing along.
[SpongeBob and Patrick follow Squidward while he is running away from them. They, of course, have their slide whistles]
Squidward: Go away! Can't you idiots take a hint?! [Squidward keeps running. Squidward runs into Goo Lagoon with SpongeBob and Patrick following him.. SpongeBob and Patrick are shown as mermen underwater, SpongeBob and Patrick have their slide whistles and are playing along with Squidward's movements..

Squidward: I think I lost 'em. [SpongeBob and Patrick are there whistling every time Squidward takes a breath.. Squidward takes SpongeBob's slide whistle]
Squidward: How would you like it if someone did this to you?! [Squidward starts playing through a fit of rage]
SpongeBob: Alright! [SpongeBob and Patrick dance along to Squidward's whistling.. SpongeBob and Patrick are floating around and dancing for a while when Squidward puts down the slide whistle and gives up, so we think]
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward! You have got quite an ear for music!
Squidward: [yelling] Don't you... I do?
SpongeBob: Yes my friend. You got... the goods!
Squidward: Well, uh...ha... that is true...
SpongeBob: Come, play some more maestro. Me and Patrick want to sing to your saweeet tunes!
Squidward: Well... If you insist...
SpongeBob: Oh! We insist!
Squidward: Okay!

[Door closes with the slide whistle effect]
Dennis: Well that's unusual. [Keeps reading. Slide whistle effect happens when he turns the pages]
Dennis: [angrily] What is that?! Who's there?! [Squidward behind the cashiers desk, laughs] Who's back here?!
[Doors close with the slide whistle effect.. Dennis looks behind him.. He hears the doors again]
Dennis: [Runs out of the store] Alright! This isn't funny! Come on jerk! You think you can mess with me?! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward laugh.. Scene cuts to the streets of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward march with slide whistles playing in a chorus]

SpongeBob: Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
[Shows Patrick with a thought cloud digging out bellybutton lint]
Patrick: Probably not.
[Squidward goes up through a streetlight and hears a couple]
Nancy: Oh honey, I'm so sorry. I promise it'll never happen again. [Nancy and Frank hug.. Squidward plays the slide whistle.. Frank gets up. Lenny walks along]
Lenny: Can I help you... [Frank punches Lenny in the face]
Frank: Liar!
Frank (red shirt): She's not lying. [angry mob appears with torches and pitchforks] She speaks the truth. Someone wicked has disturbed our peaceful city, Frank. [captions version Man: She's not lying, she speaks the truth, someone wicked has disturbed our peaceful city, Frank]
Frank: But who would do such a thing?
Frank (red shirt): Squidward! Squidward Tentacles! He lives on Conch Drive!
Frank: What?
Frank (red shirt): Yes, we must capture him. He must pay for his wrong doings!
Angry Mob: He's going to pay! He's going to pay with interest! He's going down!
[Squidward slide whistles by]
Frank (red shirt): Come on, LETS GET HIM!
[Angry mob runs after Squidward]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you think Squidward is taking this a little too far?
Patrick: He's only a block away. [crowd yelling. Policemen see the angry mob]
Police officer: What do you make of it, Sarg?
Sergeant: It looks like a full scale riot. I'm calling for backup. [On his radio] Get me the K-9 unit!

Everyone but SpongeBob and Patrick cheer happily about Squidward crashing his tanker.. SpongeBob and Patrick play a funeral march on the slide whistle.. Scene cuts to the Bikini Bottom Hospital]
Intercom: Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please. Dr. Forrest?
Purple Doctorfish: Your friend is very lucky. If it wasn't for that slide whistle getting lodged in his throat, the rescue team might have never found him. [The slide whistle starts going crazy in Squidward’s throat] His yelling, or whistling I should say, under all that rubble saved his life.
SpongeBob: Doctor, why did you leave the whistle in his throat?
Purple Doctorfish: Unfortunately, we don't have the technology to remove it yet. But on the bright side, he can still communicate with us.
[The slide whistle starts going crazy again. Squidward is actually moving the slide whistle in a fit of anger, attempting to scream at SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Wow Squidward, listen to you! You're getting better already! Here we'll help. [SpongeBob and Patrick raise their slide whistles.. SpongeBob and Patrick go around the hospital playing the slide whistle to CPR, a guy on a ventilator, and the purple doctorfish stitching Nat up]
Squidward: [is asleep in bed when his alarm wakes him up. He puts on his slippers, gets out of bed, walks to the mirror, pulls up his shirt by his collar, licks his finger, and rubs his eyebrows] Squidward, my man, you are perfect! [Squidward is walking outside with a watering can to water his kelp garden, but it's wilted] Oh no, my kelp garden is all wilted! Don't worry, fellas, I've got just the thing to perk you up. [pulls out a spray bottle] Kelp Grow! Hold still. [Squidward sprays it, and his kelp stands up and sprouts yellow flowers. Squidward sniffs it, then notices Patrick inside]
Patrick: They're pretty.
Squidward: [screams] Patrick?
SpongeBob: And SpongeBob!
Squidward: What are you two doing here?
SpongeBob: Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden.
[Patrick eats some of Squidward's kelp and burps loudly]
Squidward: Stop eating my kelp! [pushes Patrick away from his garden]
Patrick: Okay, okay, jeez. Try to help a fella out. [pulls an ice cream cone out of his pocket] I'll just have to eat this ice cream cone instead.
Squidward: Oh, do you like to eat ice cream, Patrick?
Patrick: [thinks] Yeah.
Squidward: Then have some more! [Squidward sprays the ice cream with kelp grow, and it grows more. Patrick falls from the extra weight. Squidward laughs] Still want that ice cream?
Patrick: Boy I do! Thanks, Squidward. Want some, SpongeBob? Last one to the cone is a rotten clam! [both start licking it]
Squidward: Are you done yet?
Patrick: [after eating the ice cream cone] All done.
SpongeBob: Wow, I wish I had a bottle of that kelp grow stuff. [Patrick takes Squidward's bottle and gives it to SpongeBob]
Patrick: Here you go, SpongeBob.
Squidward: Hey!
SpongeBob: Thank you, Patrick. You know my shoes feel kinda tight. [SpongeBob sprays them, and they become bigger] Huh, nice and roomy. [hands the bottle to Patrick]
Patrick: Do you want your grow juice back?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh no, I only paid for it. I wouldn't want to deprive you of it.
Patrick: Okay.
Squidward: Give me that!
Patrick: But you said you didn't want it.
Squidward: Fine! Why don't you two use it for your good deeds?
SpongeBob: That's a great idea Squidward!
Patrick: Yeah, I'll go first. [Patrick sprays Squidward's nose, and it becomes bigger]
Squidward: [screams] What did you do?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
Patrick: Quite an improvement, don't you think?
SpongeBob: Oh yes, I agree completely. Come on Patrick, let's do some good deeding!
Patrick: Yay! [they run off]
Squidward: Hey, get back here, [chases after them] and fix my nose! [SpongeBob and Patrick run up to Gary]
SpongeBob: Hey Gary, that shell of yours looks a little cramped.
Gary: Meow. [goes inside his shell. SpongeBob sprays his shell, and it becomes bigger]
SpongeBob: There, now you have plenty of space. [they run off, then Squidward runs on screen, and notices Gary's large shell]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Aha, they went this way.
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Squidward: [understanding of it] Oh, tell me about it. [walks away]
Gary: Meow. [pants. He tries to move, but it's hard with his big shell. Bubbles rise up, transitioning to SpongeBob and Patrick behind a rock]
SpongeBob: [talking about Mr. Krabs, who is throwing a penny in the air] There he is.
Patrick: Get ready.
SpongeBob: Now, Patrick! [Patrick sucks him into his belly button, then spits him out. He then sprays Mr. Krabs' penny, and it turns bigger, and crushes Mr. Krabs] There you go Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make "big money." [cuts to scene of live people groaning. Now talking to Patrick] Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward.
Patrick: You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!
SpongeBob: I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But times a wasting! We need another good deed!
Patrick: Oh, I got one! You know that thing?
SpongeBob: Um, right, that thing that we did that day.
Patrick: No, the other one. [both think, then Squidward walks on screen]
Squidward: SpongeBob! [pants and hits SpongeBob’s head] Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!
SpongeBob: Are you sure?
Patrick: Yeah, you'd be ugly again.
Squidward: Yes, I'm sure!
SpongeBob: Hmm, how to fix his nose?
Patrick: What, if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it'll shrink it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's brilliant!
Squidward: No wait, don't. [they spray his nose with the bottle upside down, and it gets bigger]
SpongeBob: That didn't work.
Patrick: Try it again.
SpongeBob: I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head.
[SpongeBob sprays Squidward's head]
Patrick: Well, now his body is too small.
SpongeBob: Right, too small. [SpongeBob sprays it]
Patrick: Arms are too short. [SpongeBob sprays his arm] Legs are too short. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's legs] Other arm. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's other arm] Feet too small. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's feet] Teeth! [SpongeBob sprays them] Belly button. [SpongeBob sprays it. Patrick blows a kiss] Perfect!
Squidward: [looks very ugly] I look horrible! [Squidward releases blue ink]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ew! [they cough] He inked!
Squidward: Well, pardon my anatomy! [Squidward gets even bigger] What's happening?
SpongeBob and Patrick: All right! [Squidward is bigger]
Squidward: What did you do to me?
Patrick: I know! I know! Um, made you a monster!
SpongeBob: And a giant.
SpongeBob and Patrick: A giant monster!
Squidward: I don't want to be a giant lumbering monster! [picks up SpongeBob and Patrick] What will I do now?
SpongeBob: That's easy, play giant lumbering monster tag!
Patrick: Yeah! Yeah! You chase us!
SpongeBob: And we run around and scream like crazy! [he and Patrick slide out of Squidward's hand] Try and catch us, giant monster Squidward! [they run away from Squidward]
Squidward: SpongeBob, come back here! [chases them]
SpongeBob: [screams] This is really fun.
Patrick: [screams] I know. We should do this... [screams] ...more often. [they run into Bikini Bottom, screaming, when Squidward is chasing them]
Nancy: [screams] A monster! [grabs Monroe's arm and begins tugging it twice as if to start a segway, and runs away, riding Monroe like a segway]
Harold, Nat, Shubie, Sally, Nazz, and Sadie: [watch SpongeBob and Patrick running away, still screaming, Squidward's feet appears. A car drives out of the way] Monster!
Medieval Fish: Monster! [As the humanized fish walks out, villagers with torches and weapons form a mob to run for Bikini Bottom. They run past Squidward to kill him.]
Male Fish: Huh? [takes out a torch from his case, then chases Squidward. Squidward finally gets SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: You are very good at pretending Squidward. Look how you're all sweaty and angry, and you got the whole town to play along. [Citizens with torches and pitchforks and rakes form a mob, surrounding Squidward.]
Squidward: What the?
Miss Shell: Kick him!
Canadian Fish: Let's get him and make back bacon!
Lifeguard: Scoop out his... eyeballs and use 'em as... giant... misshapen soccer balls!
[Taylor walks towards the mob.]
Taylor: Wait. Maybe he's a nice monster, like in my story book. [Tina and Sadie's torches extinguish.]
Lifeguard: Oh right, I, I haven't thought of that. Well, are you?
SpongeBob: Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all.
Patrick: Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face.
SpongeBob: Even though you really wanted to.
Squidward: [yells] Oh, quiet you morons!
[all gasp]
Nazz: He hurt the little one's feelings.
Shubie: Why, that's not very nice at all.
Lifeguard: [yells] Take him down boys! [Following the lifeguard fish, the mob uses a giant rake slingshot to hit his foot.]
Squidward: Ow! [holds his foot and hops backwards. Harold, Scooter, Nazz, and Fred set up a giant rake behind him. Squidward steps on it and falls down after it hits him on the back of the head. The lifeguard comes up with a big tube of lipstick.]
Lifeguard: This oughta fix him. [puts lipstick on Squidward's lips]
[The mob stops yelling.]
Squidward: Okay, okay, I'm nice. [is shown to be tied to the ground with ropes] Now will you leave me alone?
Sadie: Oh yeah? Then prove it! 
Lifeguard: Yeah! Are you nice enough to... um...
Nazz: Compliment me on my new hairdo?
Squidward: [sits up, breaking free from the ropes] Yeah, sure, whatever.
Nazz: [laughs] Oh, thank you.
Camp Councilor: Let the junior guppies camp out under your toenails? [we see fish sleeping under Squidward's toenails]
Skier: Take me to the top of Mount Humongous? [Squidward does it and the skier skis down Mt. Humongous] Whee...!
Farmer: Blow on my old windmill? [Squidward blows on a windmill]
Tyler: Do my homework?
Nat: Dust my attic?
Taylor: Feed my snail? [Squidward pants]
Shubie: Wow, this giant really is friendly after all.
Harold: He taught my grandmother how to read!
Lifeguard: He helped me start my own blimp ride company. [the blimp is really Squidward's nose]
Nat: He helped me build a... a... [sneezes]
All: [collectively] Bless you. Gesundheit. [Squidward says nothing as he did not hear Nat sneeze] Ahem?
Squidward: What?
[all gasp]
Evelyn: He didn't say bless you.
Lifeguard: Get him! [Squidward screams and runs away from the angry mob.]
Shubie: Where'd he go?
Lifeguard: Is that him over there?
Squidward: [visibly hiding behind a building] Uhh, I'm a lamp post?
Lifeguard: Oh. Well, let's go check down by the creek! We'll teach him to dip his feet! [Citizens run off while Squidward tiptoes away. Cuts to Squidward's house at night, where there is a big trap around it. Squidward touches his house, and the trap springs]
Squidward: Well Squidward, I guess this is your new life. [cuts to Squidward on a mountain] And this is your new bed. [lays down] Good night, old life. [sobs] I'll miss you.
SpongeBob: Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: [sits up] Where are you?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button. [he and Patrick are in the belly button under a blanket and using the lint as pillows]
Squidward: What the? Get out of there! [picks them out] You two have ruined my life! [starts sobbing. SpongeBob and Patrick exchange glances, then float away on a river of Squidward's giant tears]
SpongeBob: Oh Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him.
Patrick: So?
SpongeBob: We shall do him another. [cuts to SpongeBob's house the next day. Construction sounds can be heard behind a door with a sign saying "Keep Out."] We did it! [the roof opens up and a giant present that says "For Squidward" pops out. SpongeBob and Patrick leave the house and push the present over to where Squidward is sitting]
Squidward: What the?
SpongeBob: Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one. [Squidward opens it]
Squidward: A giant clarinet? [holds it up. SpongeBob and Patrick nod. Squidward plays it, then gasps] And it sounds divine! [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp excitedly. As Squidward plays, he shrinks back to normal size and falls to the ground] Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet! [starts bawling. The clarinet falls and crushes him. SpongeBob and Patrick pull him out] It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played! [sighs] Well, at least I still have my kelp garden. [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh nervously] What? [cuts to where Squidward's kelp garden is cut down] You cut it down?
SpongeBob: We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet. [Squidward gets angry, then begins to chase SpongeBob and Patrick. They scream, then laugh, then scream again]
SpongeBob: [walking around in a small circle in Jellyfish Fields] Ahh, nothing quite like a relaxing stroll [deep voice] deep [normal] in Jellyfish Fields. [a high-pitched scream in the distance] I'd know that sound anywhere! It's a terrifying shriek! But where's it coming from? [he looks from behind a rock and finds Patrick shrieking] Patrick, what is with all the shrieking? You know I walk here on Tuesdays.
Patrick: Sorry, SpongeBob. That wasn't me.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek.
Patrick: So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it.
SpongeBob: [Patrick mimicking] So, you were mimicking it. Patrick, please don't do that. It is really...
[terrifying shriek]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, if the shriek wasn’t coming from you, then where was it...it’s over there, behind that kelp shrub!
[a giant clam behind the kelp bush is shrieking]
SpongeBob: The terrifying shriek must've come from this clam.
[the clam starts coughing violently]
SpongeBob: [Patrick mimicking] Hey, Patrick, I think there's something wrong with...
[clam coughing and wheezing]
SpongeBob: W-W-What are we gonna do?
Patrick: Well, the last time I remember coughing like that, I was sitting at home, eating a box of Kelp Jerky.
SpongeBob: Oh, and you were coughing because you got something stuck in your throat?
Patrick: I got the TV remote stuck in my throat!
SpongeBob: Patrick, this clam is choking! Luckily, I come prepared! [pulls out a bottle of bubble soap] There, there, Clammy. [takes out bubble wand and spreads a line of soap under the clam’s bottom lip]
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: They like this!
Patrick: No! You always give a choking victim the Slimelich Maneuver, first! And if that doesn’t work, you walk away and pretend like you never saw them before. [walks behind the clam] Like this! Ready, clam?
[grabs the clam, tries to lift it, sprains his back, and screams in pain]
Patrick: Well, SpongeBob, I think I might go catch a movie.
SpongeBob: Hey, what about the clam?
Patrick: What clam? I've never seen that clam before in my life.
SpongeBob: But if...
[the clam spits out a pearl]
SpongeBob: Patrick, the clam had a baby!
Patrick: That's not a baby, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Well, then, what could it be?
Patrick: I'll give you a hint: what's white, round, and comes out of clams?
SpongeBob: Their...eyes?
Patrick: No, silly! A volleyball!
SpongeBob: A baby volleyball!

Harold: I got it! Ugh!
SpongeBob: Good idea coming here, Patrick.
Patrick: That's my specialty.
SpongeBob: Having good ideas?
Patrick: No, being called Patrick.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should do some stretches, first.
Patrick: Good idea!
SpongeBob: Well, that's my specialty.
Patrick: Having good ideas?
SpongeBob: Nope, doing some stretches, first.
[appraisal clerk talking on phone]
Clerk: Yeah... No... I don't know, the thing's a hundred years old, how should I know? Yeah, alright, look, if you don’t want it... [sees SpongeBob’s pearl. dreamily] Uh-huh... Yeah... We'll see... Huh, yeah. I'm... I'm... I'm still here. [hangs up]
SpongeBob: 138, 139,
Clerk: Gentlemen.
SpongeBob: Hello.
Clerk: I couldn't help noticing what a lovely ball that is.
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Clerk: Yes. I’d sure like to get a closer look.
SpongeBob: We don’t mind, do we Patrick?
Patrick: Well, just don’t take too long. We were just about to start playing with it.
Clerk: Oh, it uh…it won’t take long at all. [picks up pearl] Ooh, it’s heavier than I imagined. And, uh, shinier, too. Where’d you find it?
SpongeBob: We found it deep in Jellyfish Fields.
Clerk: Really? What was it doing there?
SpongeBob: Choking a clam.
Clerk: Well, um…ahem…what would you say if I were to offer you a small fortune in exchange for your shiny ball?
Patrick: What do you mean, ‘small fortune?’
[hundreds of trucks bring cash to SpongeBob’s house while SpongeBob and Patrick eat Kelp Jerky]
SpongeBob: Whoa. How many more trucks do you think there’ll be, Patrick?
Patrick: Huh? Oh, I don’t know. I am getting kinda hungry, though. I’ll catch up with you later, SpongeBob.
[last truck leaves]
SpongeBob: Well, that looked like the last of them.
Patrick: The last of what?
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick.
Patrick: So, did you figure out what you’re gonna do with this fat stack of cabbage, yet?
SpongeBob: Yup…I mean, nope.
Patrick: Well, my dad always told me: when you have money, you need to do more than just spend it. You need to have a plan.
SpongeBob: Wow, your dad really told you that?
Patrick: Well, what he said was, ‘How many times do I have to tell you not to stand there?’ But I knew what he meant.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, I know a good place to go when you don’t know what to buy.
Patrick: You do?
SpongeBob: The mall!
[SpongeBob and Patrick go to the mall]
Both: Whoo!
[SpongeBob throws a baseball glove at Patrick]
Both: Touchdown!
[they go look at baby clams]
Both: Aw!
[two bite at SpongeBob’s eyelids]
SpongeBob: Patrick, where’d you go?
[Patrick pulls off the clams]
SpongeBob: Oh, there you are.
[they then go to listen to headphones. SpongeBob’s headphones work, but Patrick’s don’t play any music. He pulls at the cord without realizing that both their headphones are connected, and pulls off the top of SpongeBob’s head, revealing his brain. Patrick puts it back on, and SpongeBob puts his hand on Patrick’s shoulder. they head home]
SpongeBob: Patrick, that was the best shopping day ever!
Patrick: You can say that again!
SpongeBob: Best shopping day ever! Patrick, I got an idea!
Patrick: Really?
SpongeBob: Let’s go shopping again! And this time, buy stuff!
[they head home from the mall with shopping carts and money sticking out of their clothes]
SpongeBob: Oh, wasn’t that incredible, Patrick? I mean, with all this money, we could’ve bought anything in the whole world!
Patrick: Yup!
SpongeBob: So tell me, what’d you buy?
Patrick: A lifetime supply of strawberry gum!
SpongeBob: Hey, me, too! And to think we barely even put a dent in my fortune!
Narrator: The following Thursday...
[at an ice cream stall]
SpongeBob: Two, please: one for me and one for my best friend, Patrick.
Lou: I didn’t really ask who they were for.
SpongeBob: Thanks. [gives him a wad of bills] There you go.
Lou: It was only fifty-nine cents for the ice cream.
SpongeBob: Oh, that’s okay. I kinda have more money than I know what to do with right now.
Lou: Looks like my ex-wife was wrong. I am in the right line of work!
Bill: Uh, triple-blueberry sundae, please. Extra nuts.
Lou: Sure. That’s gonna be $2.98.
Bill: Uh…hey Bert, you got like eight cents I can borrow?
Bert: Yeah, let me check…no, I don’t, Bill, Sorry.
Bill: You know, why is it I always have money when you need to borrow it?
Bert: Well, I don’t know what to say…I…
SpongeBob: Are you gentlemen low on funds? Let me help. [gives wad to Bill] Here you go.
Bill: Whoa. Uh, t-that’s okay, I just need eight cents.
SpongeBob: That’s okay, I already got my ice cream. See?
Bill: Okay, um…thanks.
SpongeBob: Sure thing. Do you need some, too, Bert?
Bert: Okay!
Dale: Excuse me, can I have some, too?
SpongeBob: Oh, you wanna buy some ice cream?
Dale: No, I’m allergic. But, I’ll be you’re best friend.
SpongeBob: It’s a deal!
Bill: Hey, I think I can hang out with this guy for a while.

[crowd leaves with SpongeBob]
Patrick: Ice cream?
[Patrick knocks on SpongeBob’s new mansion]
Butler: Hmm…yes?
Patrick: Uh…I’m here to see SpongeBob.
Butler: I know, you on the guest list, sir?
Patrick: Well, I don’t think so. Normally, I…
Butler: Well, then, I’m afraid I can’t let you in, sir. Good day, sir.
Patrick: Good day. Uh, your shoe’s untied.
Butler: Hmm, right-o, it is. [Patrick walks inside] Thank you, sir.
Bert: And so, he was like, do you wanna buy some ice cream? Ha ha, ice cream! Can you imagine?
Bill: Ha ha, yeah. Ah, I love that story!
Patrick: Uh, hey guys. Have you seen SpongeBob around?
Bert: Eh…is that guy talking to us?
Bill: Just don’t move. Or breathe. He might go away.
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
Nat Peterson: Hey, pal, watch it. I can buy and sell you!
SpongeBob: And I said, go ahead, let’s do it right now! I got too much hair, anyways.
[crowd laughs]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: That’s my name, don’t wear it out.
Patrick: SpongeBob, I gotta tell you something I think you should know: your house is full of strangers!
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, these aren’t strangers. These are 497 of my closest friends. Right everybody? [crowd cheers] That right!
[SpongeBob throws cash in the air and the crowd cheers and grabs for it]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you hear that? That is the sound of love.
Patrick: SpongeBob, if you keep throwing your money away like that, you won’t have any left to…
Mr. Krabs: Excuse me sir, is this man giving you trouble?
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Like I was saying…
Patrick: But…
Mr. Krabs: We don’t want any trouble, now just keep moving.
Teenage fish: Dude, how do you get in there?
SpongeBob: And I told him, it’s not that I mind the macaroni, what I mind is…
Mr. Krabs: Sorry about that, SpongeBob. Won’t happen again.
SpongeBob: No matter, he’s simply jealous of my glamorous new lifestyle.
Mr. Krabs: Say, that reminds me…can I have some money?
SpongeBob: Why certainly. I always remember to… [pulls out empty pocket. Crowd gasps] Oh, I forgot. I keep it in this other pocket. [empty pocket. Crowd gasps] Uh, will you excuse me for a moment?
[SpongeBob goes around checking his safe, piggy bank, golden toilet, and Gary’s shell. He has no money left]
SpongeBob: Noooooooooo! [walks back to party] Well, everyone, I hope this doesn’t put a damper on things, but I just checked and, well it’s just that all my money is… [everyone is gone] …gone.
Mr. Krabs: Don’t be late for work tomorrow, boy.
[Patrick’s rock, where Patrick is relaxing]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, hey SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing?
Patrick: Oh, the same thing us sea stars are usually doing, I guess. Laying up against a rock.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I was wrong.
Patrick: About what?
SpongeBob: The money, and about those people being my friends.
Patrick: There is no right or wrong when it comes to that stuff, SpongeBob. There just either ‘is’ or there ‘isn’t.’
SpongeBob: Patrick, if having a bunch of money makes me forget that forget that you’re my best friend, then I don’t want anymore money, ever again.
Patrick: Well, why didn’t you say so, buddy? I’ve been waiting for someone to go break in my new volleyball with!
SpongeBob: You got another new volleyball?
Patrick: Yup, I found it!
SpongeBob: Found it? Where?
Patrick: Inside the Bikini Bottom Diamond Mine!
Quincy: Next! Oh, no...
SpongeBob: Hey, Quincy! How's my favorite money-man?
Quincy: SpongeBob... what can I do for you?
SpongeBob: The new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards come out today! So I need to take out some mon-ey.
Quincy: Ugh. Let me see your bank book.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Quincy, sure thing. [takes out his bank book]
Quincy: Nice... bunnies.
SpongeBob: I know, I know. It's so embarrassing. [whispering] I wanted the one with the kittens on it.
Quincy: Right. [pulls out SpongeBob's money] Here you are, sir.
SpongeBob: Thank you. Hm... Um, Quincy, this one is wrinkled. I couldn't possibly give this to Mermaid Man. It simply won't do.
Quincy: I don't think they go directly to Mermaid Man, SpongeBob. But, um. Here. Try this one. [hands SpongeBob a dollar]
SpongeBob: [sniffs the dollar] This one... smells funny.
Customer in line: Come on! Would ya hurry up?
Customer with mask and money bag: Yeah, some of us have withdrawals to make, ya know?
All customers: [complaining]
SpongeBob: Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect. [gets kicked out of bank] Whoa!
All customers: [cheering]
[SpongeBob and Patrick are at Near Mint Comic Books.]
Patrick: One, two, three, four...
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Counting up your change for a pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading cards?
Patrick: No, I'm thinking about buying this book on counting. Three, four. What's gonna happen next? FIVE? Holy super-happy-fun-time! This book's good! I'll take it! One, two, three...
SpongeBob: One pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards, please.
Comic book dealer: [gets a pack of cards]
SpongeBob: All right!
Comic book dealer: Not so fast! Where's my dollar?
SpongeBob: [pulls out a roll of dollars and pulls one off] Here you are, my good sir.
Comic book dealer: Here you go, kid.
Patrick: Seventeen...
SpongeBob: So... shiny... and smooth! [rubs it against his face and smells it] Ah... oh! Oh! [opens cards] Oooh! Mermaid Man's bubble-powered wheelchair from season twelve! And Barnacle Boy's bunion! Holy scallops! It's the dentures that Mermaid Man used to pop the Dirty Bubble in episode four-hundred two! Wow! These must be the most valuable cards in the world! I'll treasure them forever.
Comic book dealer: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Those cards aren't worth nothin'. I wouldn't put those cards in the spokes of my bike. Now, if you wanna see a card worth talkin' about, check this one out. This is the super-rare platinum hologram animated talking card: number fifty-four.
Voice: Mermaid Man says: [fist swings by and hits Barnacle Boy, while Mermaid Man barely ducks out of the way]
Mermaid Man: Buy more cards!
Comic book dealer: There are only five in existence.
SpongeBob: How much is it? For this one?
Comic book dealer: This one's just a display. If you want a real one, you'll have to buy as many packs as you can and hope you get lucky.
SpongeBob: [buys another pack] Oh, I have a good feeling about this one. Oh, come on. And it's... not there. [throws the cards and buys more] Mmm... no. [process continues until there is only one pack left] Ohhh! (close up on SpongeBob's face) I'll never find card fifty-four!
Patrick: Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! Oh! I hate counting! Just give me what he's having! Oh, boy! Let's see which card I got! Is this a good card, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No, it's just another...
Voice: Mermaid Man says
Mermaid Man: Buy more cards!
SpongeBob: Number fifty-four! That's the best card there is!
Patrick: It sure does the job, all right. [flossing his teeth with number fifty-four]
SpongeBob: Aaahhhhh!! Patrick, you're picking your teeth with it!
Patrick: I'm preventing gingivitis. [it looks like he already has it]
SpongeBob: Patrick! That's the ultra-rare number fifty-four talking card! It's really valuable and there's only five in existence. And [gibberish] Patrick! Blah blah blzzz! So now do you understand why you should take really could care of that card?
Patrick: Yes, sir. [starts picking his teeth with the card]
[Patrick walks with SpongeBob out of the store.]
SpongeBob: I can't let anything happen to that card. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy would never forgive me! Patrick, watch out! You almost tripped on that crack. [puts card in a tiny seat belt on Patrick's hand] Whew! Now watch where you're going!
Patrick: Okay. Thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: [a bus drives towards a mud puddle on the road next to them] Patrick, look out! [he jumps in front of Patrick to avoid mud from hitting the card, getting covered in mud in the process. A log of mud slowly slides out of his mouth] Ha, that was close.
Patrick: Ha, ha. SpongeBob fly.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is serious. You're carrying precious cargo now. You can't just wander aimlessly around like you've been...
Patrick: What? [walks into Goo Lagoon]
SpongeBob: The card!  [he jumps into the water and stops the card from going underwater by picking up Patrick as he sinks. He carries him to the other side, then puts him down] Patrick, why'd you just walk into Goo Lagoon?
Patrick: SpongeBob, you can't always expect my usual brand of stupidity. I like to mix it up. Keep you on your toes. [falls from a construction site and almost lands in fire]
SpongeBob: Ahhh! [jumps in a crane, saves Patrick and drags him back to his home] Here we are! Home safe home! And nothing happened to the card.
Patrick: Good job, SpongeBob. Now let me just get my keys. [pulls out ice cream cone] Nope. [pulls out key] There you are. I knew you were in there somewhere.
SpongeBob: The super-rare and priceless Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading card! Patrick! Where is it? Where is it? Dear Neptune! You didn't put it in your pocket, did you? It's getting all bent up! Bent up! [wailing] Bent up! Bent up! Bent, bent, bent, bent up!
Patrick: Sheesh. Don't get your pants up in a square knot, SpongeBob. I don't even believe in pockets. I keep everything I need right here. In the folds of my back fat. [pulls card out of his back] You seem to be pretty fond of this little thing. Why don't you just keep it?
SpongeBob: You mean... [sniffles] you'd give me your most valuable possession?
Patrick: I'd give you my most valuable possession? [They hug]
SpongeBob: You're the best pal ever.
Patrick: I'm the best pal ever. But can you do me one favor?
SpongeBob: Sure, pal. Anything for you.
Patrick: Do you mind if I hold on to it? Just for today?
SpongeBob: Um, sure, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, good. 'Cause my landlord changed the lock again.
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait! Let me call a locksmith.
Patrick: Oh! I don't need any old locksmith. [starts picking the lock with the card]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! Don't ya think maybe... that you shouldn't...
Patrick: Ugh! [his rock opens up] Man, this card is fantastic! [Patrick's stomach growls] Breaking and entering sure makes a fella hungry. Hey, why don't we eat some dinner? And then I'll give you your card. [gets a barbecue grill] Ew! This barbecue's really filthy. Oh, but this'll take care of it.
SpongeBob: No, wait, Patrick! Allow me to clean it!
Patrick: Now, now, SpongeBob I know you wanna help, but you're my guest. [scrapes grill with talking card] There! Nice and shiny! [SpongeBob's lips quiver and his eyes are wide with shock. Patrick uses a coral stick to scrape the card like a match. As the card smokes, Patrick blows the card and it's lit on fire. He burns the charcoal rocks with it. Close up on SpongeBob's eyes as he sees the card burning as a fire alarm ringing sound is heard in the background.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! The card! It's on fire!
Patrick: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll take care of it. [As Patrick hawks up, he spits on the card putting out the fire.] There! Good as new!
SpongeBob: [as he sees the saliva on the card] Ew.
Patrick: [flips burgers with card] Dinner is served. [serves two cheeseburgers on the card. As Patrick eats his burger, SpongeBob gets his burger, but the melted cheese is stuck to the card so he pulls it off getting cheese on it. A bubble in the cheese bulges then pops, destroying the card's talking feature]
Mermaid Man: [garbled as the card is getting ready to break] More cards...
Patrick: [burps] Oh! Pardon me! That hit the spot! [wipes his face with the card like a napkin really getting cheese all over it.] Hey! Look at that! [The sun sets below the horizon in the distance] Sundown already? Well, you can have your card now. I hope you get as much use out of it as I have.
[SpongeBob whines over his card as it starts to short circuit]
Mermaid Man: Zzbbb... more cards... [the card disintegrates into a pile of black dust on his hand as the music from the card warps down]
SpongeBob: Oh! It's ruined! [he starts to cry, his eyes blow tears out, and he runs away crying as the tears rain down on Patrick]
Patrick: [he walks up to his friend] SpongeBob, what's wrong?
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Now I'll never have Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy card #54, the special talking one!
Patrick: [puts a comforting arm around SpongeBob] Aw... sure you will.
SpongeBob: No. No! I spent all my money! And, [gasps] and, [gasps] and, you bought that last pack! So there's no more left in all of Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: Well, how about these? [pulls out four trading cards]
Announcer: Mermaid Man says... [four fists punch four Barnacle Boys on the four cards]
Mermaid Man: Buy more cards! (x4)
SpongeBob: [whispers] Number 54! Patrick, where did you get these?!
Patrick: Well, that pack I bought was full of 'em.
SpongeBob: [makes one last sniffle as he stops crying] May I... have one?
Patrick: They're all yours, buddy. See ya tomorrow.
SpongeBob: [happy as he feels better] Wow!
Patrick: Oh! Hey, SpongeBob? Can I borrow one of those cards? [points to his rock] I locked myself out of my house again. [episode ends]
SpongeBob: [sweeping]
Mr. Krabs: [moving his hands around over a table with a banner above it]
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [turns his head to see who was talking to him] Oh. Ahoy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, that's over with, Now why don't you go see if First Mate Squidward needs any help at the register?
Squidward Tentacles: [standing around, doing nothing. He is covered in spider webs]
SpongeBob: And what are you up to on this fine, fine Monday?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I was gonna wait til this afternoon, but I guess I could show you now.
SpongeBob: Show me what?
Mr. Krabs: I'm introducing a new Krusty Krab promotion.
SpongeBob: Ah! You are?!
Mr. Krabs: I sure am. [starts to walk away. Here, the banner above the table is revealed to say, New Krusty Krab Promotion. On the table, there are three cups]
SpongeBob: Who are ya gonna introduce it to?
Mr. Krabs: Well, all my loyal customers, of course!
Squidward: Ha!
Mr. Krabs: [glares at Squidward] Anyway, we got new beverage cups.
SpongeBob: Wow.
Mr. Krabs: [pointing to the cups] There's Regular, Large, and the new Viking Size!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, these are all the same size cup.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, this promotion is designed to save US money. Now, don't forget. Each participating patron who purchases any drink in our new Krusty Krab Viking Size cup gets to a chance to try on this genuine cardboard Viking helmet. [holds up a cardboard helmet that is taped and has three fake emeralds taped to it]
Squidward: That he found while cleaning out his attic over the weekend.
Mr. Krabs: Don't you know when you're being ignored?
Squidward: You're the only one talking.
SpongeBob: [staring at the Viking helmet] Mr. Krabs... [reaches out to take the helmet] it's beautifu-
Mr. Krabs: Not so fast! Access to the mighty helmet will be granted to active promotion participants only. And only those who purchase Viking Size.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what's a Viking?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, uh... the Vikings lived a long time ago.
SpongeBob: How long?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I, uh, about ten years.
SpongeBob: And?
Mr. Krabs: Uh..... [walks to his office] You're gonna have to ask Squidward any more questions ya got. He's the smart one. [closes his office door]
Squidward: Barnacle butt.
SpongeBob: [appears next to Squidward] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: Ay! What do you want?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said you were gonna teach me all about the Vikings.
Squidward: Oh really?
SpongeBob: Will ya teach me, huh?!
Squidward: Sure! I'll teach ya. Listen closely now. The Vikings were....
Vikings: [standing, some with weapons]
Squidward: a race of scholars and scientists who lived before even Mr. Krabs was born.

Squidward: They are believed to have discovered ketchup....
Viking: [holding a leash]
Squidward: ...and enjoyed dressing up their pets as....
Brick with legs: [tied to a the leash. It barks]
Squidward: scrambled masonry on the weekends.
Vikings: [watching a movie on a projector screen. It shows two fish in a car]
Squidward: Their favorite movies are in black and white.
Guy with ax on projector screen: [appears]
Viking: Look out!
Other Vikings and guy with axe: Sssshhhhhhhhh!
Squidward: And grown Vikings are known to collect socks which they display and trade at monthly sock trading conventions called Sock'n Garten.
Vikings: Sock'n Garten.
SpongeBob: Whoa....
Squidward: [goes back to reading his magazine]
SpongeBob: Squidward, do you think Vikings really drink their beverages in Viking Size?
Squidward: [sarcastically, but enthusiastically] Of course they do! How else Mr. Krabs come up with such a brilliant idea?
SpongeBob: Do you think that-
Squidward: SpongeBob! Can't you see I am trying to work?
SpongeBob: But-
Squidward: [annoyed] But what?!
SpongeBob: There's so much more about Vikings that I wanna find out.
Squidward: [now angry] Well, then why don't you go ASK THEM?!
SpongeBob: [Gasp!] Thanks, Squidward! [kisses Squidward on the Head]
SpongeBob: [returns to the kitchen. While flipping Krabby Patties, he reads a letter as he writes it] Dear Vikings, I am writing to ask you guys about your lives and stuff. [Now, he is shown walking to a mailbox with his mouth closed, but you can still hear his voice] If you would take the time to [puts the letter in the mailbox] answer all my neat questions, [starts to walk away] then that would be [walks back to the mailbox and puts the red flag up] really swell.
The scence cuts to the post office.
[A mailfish drives a car full of sacks of letters to the post office. After sorting a few letters, he comes across SpongeBob's envelope, which says, "To Vikings" with a heart below the words. He takes the envelope, walks outside, and throws it away. Two men in a garbage truck pull up to the garbage cans. The men play rock, paper, scissors. The man who was driving plays paper, and the other man plays scissors. The driver goes outside, grabs a garbage can, and trips on his own shoe lace. Trash spills everywhere, but SpongeBob's letter lands right in front of the driver. He picks the envelope up, takes one look at it and stands up. The other garbage man knocks on the windshield of the truck, but the driver just runs away. His hat falls off to reveal a Viking helmet. A viking waits at the bus stop with Fred, Old Man Jenkins, and Ms. Shell. Fred, Old Man Jenkins, and Ms. Shell stare at the garbage-scented Viking. a bus drives through sun light, rain, and snow. Meanwhile, the Viking is shown riding a bike. He rides around mountains. Soon, the top of the mountain range is shown.]
Viking King: [on his throne, between two female Vikings] Ah, Helga. Tell me once again of the time ye visited those remote Himalayan hot springs.
Viking: [crawls through the door of the palace, out of breath and filthy] A letter. [goes unconscious]
Viking King: [angry and banging his fists] Why must you always come in here during story time?!
Viking: But... but, I-
Viking King: Guards!
[the guards grab the Viking]
Viking: [drops the envelope] Please! No! You don't understand! I was only trying to.... eh...
[they throw the Viking]
Helga: Your Majesty! Look! A letter!
Viking King: How incredibly interesting! I must read it at once.
The scene cuts to the Krusty Krab.
[Squidward is reading his magazine. The whole restaurant shakes like crazy. Squidward neither says nor does anything. A large Viking ship crashes through the front of the KK. Some Vikings get off]
Squidward: [bored, and still reading his magazine] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Tough Viking: Ve're Vikings. Our chief has sent us here because [holds up SpongeBob's letter] ve've got this letter.
Squidward: SpongeBob, there's some Vikings here to see you.

Tough Viking: Vun of the things Vikings like to do is... redecorate.
[The vikings run around. They chop a table with their axes, punch the soda machine, tip over a table holding some pots and pans, and torch a urinal]
SpongeBob: How interesting.
Tough Viking: [there is fire everywhere] And another thing ve Vikings like to do is appropriate. [pulls on the cash register until the wires snap, and throws it on the ship]
SpongeBob: What a fascinating culture.
Tough Viking: And on occasion,... the Vikings... [pulls out a rope] ve've been known to liberate. [ties Squidward up with the rope]
Squidward: What the?! Hey! You can't do [gets thrown onto the ship] thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-!
SpongeBob: [tied up by a rope] I can't believe how much I'm learning.
[The vikings row the ship away after throwing SpongeBob on]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, I'll be back in one hour. I'm going on my lunch break. [sees the fire] Squidward?
The scene cuts to the Viking ship.
Squidward: Would you mind telling us what this is all about?
Tough Viking: [spitting] Shes. [P.S. He started to say sure, but changed to yes] Now that you're part of our crew,... I guess we should introduce ourselves. [punches a Viking on the chest] This is Olaf. [slaps a Viking on the chest] And this is Olaf. [points to a Viking] And this is Olaf. [points to a Viking] This... is Olaf, Olaf, Olaf, Olaf, And... um.... [covers his eyes and snaps his fingers]
Viking: Olaf.
Tough Viking: Olaf.
Squidward: So, let me guess. Your name must be....
Tough Viking: That's right. Gordon.
SpongeBob: Nice to meet ya.
Gordon: Now. Before I put you two to verk, I vanna know vhat...
SpongeBob: Wait! I still have lots more questions about the Vikings' way of life.
Gordon: Like what?
SpongeBob: Well, like... what do the Vikings like to do for fun?
Gordon: Hm... fun. Um, um, um, uh, vell,....
Green Olaf: What about the Shield Toss?
Gordon: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. [grabs a shield and throws it at a door]
SpongeBob: Anything else?
Gordon: Um.....
Green Olaf: Oh! What about Flaming Shield Toss?
Gordon: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [grabs another shield, lights it on fire with a torch, and throws it at the door]
Olafs: [clap]
SpongeBob: Anything else?
Vikings: [think]
Gordon: Eh, I, I, I can't really think of anything.
Green Olaf: Me neither. Oh, yeah!
Gordon: Vhat is it, Olaf?
Green Olaf: We like to sing songs.
Gordon, Purple Olaf, and Orange Olaf: Ooh....... No we don't!
Green Olaf: [being carried away] Wait! No! Okay, I admit it was a lousy idea! I promise it won't happen again! [gets thrown into a catapult]
Gordon: You got that right.
Green Olaf: [gets launched by the catapult. He screams, and splashes into the ocean]
Gordon: Any other questions?
SpongeBob: [stunned] I'll let you know if I think of anything.
Gordon: So. Tell me. Vhat is it that you two know how to do?
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs tells me I'm pretty good with a spatula.
Squidward: Ha.

Gordon: Impressive. You'll be the ship's bathroom attendant.
SpongeBob: A Promotion. Congratulations, Squidward!
Squidward: [appears in front of Gordon] Hold it right there, whiskers! Let's not forget you're the one who dragged me onto this crate in the first place! Now, you ask me to pour my heart out, and this is the respect I get?! Well, you got another thing coming, honey! I want off this boat, pronto! [appears in the catapult] On second thought, bathroom attendants make me some tips. Well, look on the bright side, Squidward. No more living next door to SpongeBob. Let her rip, Jack-o!
[Purple Olaf pulls back his hammer and gets ready to launch Squidward]
SpongeBob: Wait! [stops the hammer] You can't do that.
Gordon: You mean to question the vill of the tribe?
SpongeBob: If it means saving my best friend, then yes.
Gordon: [throws an axe in front of SpongeBob] Vell. Then pick up the veapon and fight the equivalent of according to the prophecy. [pulls a sword out of no where]
Olafs: Do it, do it, do it, do it!
Gordon: Go on. Pick it up!
SpongeBob: But.... [struggles to pick up the ax]
Gordon: Go on. Veakling.
Purple Olaf: Heh! Owned!
SpongeBob: But, but I...
[The ship crashes into an iceburg. An alarm sounds, and everyone panics]
Blue Olaf: We're being attacked by a giant monster. This is the end, uh, the end, uh, of the Vikings!
Olaf: Oh, Vahalla. Why have you forsaken us?
SpongeBob: Guys, you just ran into a piece of ice. No one's forsaken you. There's a breach in the hull over there. You just gotta patch it up.
Gordon: [pulls out a blanket] Quick! Everybody take one of these!
SpongeBob: What's that for?
Gordon: It's a security blanket.
SpongeBob: But, how ya gonna patch up a leak with that?
Gordon: Ve're not. But it makes us feel so much better.
[SpongeBob runs away]
Gordon: Vait! You forgot yer blanket!
Squidward: [still tied up in the catapult] What the barnacles is going on down there?
[SpongeBob appears next to him]
SpongeBob: Pardon me, Squidward! [breaks the rope that was tying Squidward with his spatula]
Squidward: [sliding down the catapult] It's all yours.
SpongeBob: Thanks. [lassos a mast and the catapult turns] There.
Purple Olaf: Look up there! What's he doing?
SpongeBob: Here goes nothing! [throws his spatula at the pedal. The catapult launches him into the breech in the hull.. The ship straightens up, the vikings cheer]
SpongeBob: Now that's what I call a Viking-sized adventure!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check. Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie.
Mailman: Sorry. No check. But I've got this. [gives Mr. Krabs a bottle and walks away]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh? [reading] Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard! [not reading. Gasp!] Grandpa Readbeard comin’ bla, bla, bla!
SpongeBob: I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, "The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws." And he wanted me to be a pirate, too.
[He flashes back to when he was a baby. His grandpa was babysitting him on his pirate ship]
Baby Mr. Krabs: [chewing a rattle]
Grandpa Redbeard: [fighting pirate skeletons] One day, you'll be a plunderin' pirate just like yer ol' granddad here.
Mr. Krabs: So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....
Crew member: Aaarrrrr!
Mr. Krabs: And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.
Crew members: [lined up to get paid]
Mr. Krabs: I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. ‘Twas also the last time I saw me granddad.
Grandpa Redbeard: Aaarrr, if it ain't me pirate grandson.
Young Mr. Krabs: Well, actually, Grandpa,...I just sold...
Grandpa Redbeard: Ya know how proud it makes me to see me only grandson continuin' in the family business.
Young Mr. Krabs: Yeah, uh, Grandpa...
Grandpa Redbeard: And I'll be keepin' me eye on yer career to see how you progress. Just remember, the only rule in the Pirate's Code of Honor is: Never tell a lie.
[The flashback ends]
Mr. Krabs: For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.
Mr. Krabs: Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.
SpongeBob: We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah.
[An hour or two pass]
Mr. Krabs: All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate. [puts a bandana on Squidward] I want you to talk like a pirate.
SpongeBob: Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!
Mr. Krabs: But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate. [smells Patrick] Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!
[A few minutes pass]
Mr. Krabs: [breaks the bar holding the tableabove the ground. He sticks it in the cash register for a steering wheel]
Squidward: [starts painting the floor of the Krusty Krab black]
Patrick: [hammers two wooden boards together]
SpongeBob: [puts the Krusty Krab sign on the roof]
Patrick: [breaks a wooden board with his hammer]
SpongeBob: [removes the shell from the pole and replaces it with a crow's nest]
Patrick: [breaks another wooden board]
SpongeBob: [pours garbage into a bucket and stirs it]
Patrick: [glues some broken wooden board pieces together]
Squidward: [paints some wave-shaped pieces of cardboard]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls on a rope and releases the Jolly Roger]
Patrick: [glues the final wood piece to the rest to make the rim of the ship]
Mr. Krabs: Way to go, fellars.
Grandpa Redbeard: [swings to the ship] Hee-ar!
Mr. Krabs: He's comin'!
Grandpa Redbeard: Har, har, har!
Mr. Krabs: Hide me, boy.
Grandpa Redbeard: Eugene, me boy! Aye, it's good to see you and yer ship after so many moons! Just beginin' to think you was lyin' to yer old granddad!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I...Heh, heh. So, have ya met me hearties?
Grandpa Redbeard: Hm...this might be a pirate crew. But more miserable jellyfishers than swarvy brine-skimmers.
SpongeBob: Um...
Grandpa Redbeard: Har, har, har! I'm just yankin' yer chain, boy! You look like a fine pirate crew.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
Grandpa Redbeard: Now, let's see what this rusty old pelican can do! Let's sail!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Aye, sir!
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast.
Mr. Krabs: Indeed, indeed. And just look at the treacherous surf in our path!
Squidward: [hanging from the front of the ship and moving the pieces of cardboard he painted to make it look like waves]
Patrick: [hanging from the window. He takes a drink of water and spits it on Grandpa Redbeard]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.
Grandpa Redbeard: Aye.
Mr. Krabs: I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, "Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!"
SpongeBob: Oh! [turns on a record player. It makes wind noises]
Mr. Krabs: There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, apparently me cabin is haunted as well.
Grandpa Redbeard: [picks up a hair net] What's a hair net doin' on a pirate ship? Every pirate knows that the majority of his daily nutrition comes from whatever hair or skin flakes fall off the coke and into the stew. This hair net is deprivi' your crew of its essential nutrients.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, just a sec. [turns a video projector on] Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack! [The video projector shows a kraken emerging from the water]
Kraken: Grrrrrr....
Grandpa Redbeard: Aye, look at the size of that beast.
Mr. Krabs: Not to worry, Granddad. [grabs a harpoon]
Grandpa Redbeard: Aha! That's the stuff!
Mr. Krabs: [throws harpoon] Yaahh! Uh... good toss, eh, Granddad?
Grandpa Redbeard: Whah!
SpongeBob: [catches the harpoon]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nothing. Look! [The video projector shows a harpoon landing on the Kraken and knocking him underwater]
Grandpa Redbeard: Har, har, har, har! That's me boy!
Mr. Krabs: Clear!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Patrick: Hooray!
SpongeBob: Woo-hoo!
Mr. Krabs: Sounds like we got a prize. [whispering] Ready, Squidward?
Squidward: You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs. [takes off his bandana and inflates his head]
Mr. Krabs: Ar! Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog! Woo! Check the size of this, Granddad.[He is holding Squidward, who looks like the Kraken] Check the... Granddad?
Grandpa Redbeard: Ahoy! Trouble aproachin' quick! Approximately ten clips of the starboard bow! Man your battle stations!
Mr. Krabs: Oh no. If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal.
Grandpa Redbeard: What have ya got, cotton in yer ears?! Move!
SpongeBob: [stacks some bags of sand]
Patrick: [raises the Jolly Roger]
Squidward: [reading a book]
Mr. Krabs: What exactly are we dealin' with, Grandpa?
Grandpa Redbeard: Somethin' bigger than I've ever seen! A ravin' garganst comin' by with coarsmatic tangled locks!
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp!] Oh, so depulsive.
Grandpa Redbeard: Yeah. It must be destroyed! Here, see for yourself. [gives Mr. Krabs a telescope]
Mr. Krabs: Go get it, Granddad.
Pearl: Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. What kinda disgusting, horrible abomination is dare invade me vessel? [looks over the rim of the ship]
Pearl: Dad!
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp!] That disgusting, horrible thing is me daughter!
Grandpa Redbeard: [points a cannon at Pearl]
Pearl: Open up!
Grandpa Redbeard: Prepare to meet yer maker, sea witch.
Mr. Krabs: Nooooo! [puts out the fuse on the cannon]
Grandpa Redbeard: What are ya doin'?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I, oh, I was just checkin' the cannon and makin' sure it was loaded. [The cannon collapses]
Grandpa Redbeard: What is this?!
Mr. Krabs: I can explain.
Pearl: Dad! Dad!
Grandpa Redbeard: Now it's even more angry!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry! I have it under control! [jumps off the ship]
Pearl: Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!
Pearl: What's with the lame outfit?
Mr. Krabs: What? Oh, never mind that! [pushes Pearl away] Just go home. [climbs back up the ship]
Grandpa Redbeard: [breaks a cardboard wave]
Mr. Krabs: I bet you're wondering about that.
Grandpa Redbeard: Ar, you're darn tootin' I am!
Patrick: [spits on Grandpa Redbeard]
Mr. Krabs: Do you mind?
Grandpa Redbeard: What kinda ship are you runnin' here?
Mr. Krabs: Just a second. [removes the wind record from the record player and throws it on Grandpa Redbeard's nose]
Grandpa Redbeard: Arrrrrrrrrrrr! Arrrrrrrrrrrr!
Mr. Krabs: Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation.
Grandpa Redbeard: I've smelled sticky things, but nothin' smells stckier than a lie! The code that all pirates live by, you knows what it is, don't ya?
Mr. Krabs: Of course I do, Granddad.
Grandpa Redbeard: Well, then, say it!
Mr. Krabs: It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies! [starts crying] And I've been a dirty liar! Everything you see is a lie! This sail is a lie! [tears down the sail] This crew is a lie! [rips their pirate clothes, leaving SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward, naked.] Even the ship is a lie! [takes a ball and breaks the roof of the ship, which made SpongeBob, Patrick &amp; Squidward ran away. He destroys the whole ship, leaving the KK standing] All of it! All a lie!
Grandpa Redbeard: Krabby Patties: $2.00. Krusty Combo: $3.99! Coral Bits: $1.95?!
Mr. Krabs: You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye.
Grandpa Redbeard: Fail, me boy?! Ha, ha, ha! Why, I couldn't be more proud. Look at yer ludicrous prices! Now, that's real piracy. Ya done good, boy-o!
Mr. Krabs: Really? Thanks, Granddad!
Grandpa Redbeard: Why, thank yourself, lad! You created this dynasty on yer own! Now, I'll be takin' me lead, boy!
Mr. Krabs: Goodbye, Granddad! What an honest man!
Grandpa Redbeard: [steals Mr. Krabs' money] I hope ya don't mind, boy-o, but I helped myself to a little bit of yer booty! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: I knew I got me talent from someone! [laughs]
SpongeBob: ♪ Workin' at the Krusty Krab! Workin' at the Krusty Krab! La, la, la, la! Loo...♪ Squidward? Squidward? [snaps fingers four times] Squidward, are you okay?
Squidward: Hm? Oh! I couldn't be better!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! It happened again, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about?
SpongeBob: It's Squidward!
Squidward: [smiling and staring into the distance]
SpongeBob: What is it about the third Wednesday of every month that makes Squidward so happy?
Mysterious man: Psst. Squidward?
Squidward: Roger! Is that you?
Mysterious man: Tonight's the big night!
Squidward: [Gasp!]
A few hours pass. It is night now.
SpongeBob: These camouflage outfits should help us find out what Squidward's secret Wednesday secret is!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling]
Squidward: [walks out of his house]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [dive into kelp. When Squidward walks away, they follow him]
Squidward: [sitting at bus stop. The bus arrives, and Squidward gets in]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hiding under Squidward's bus seat]
The bus arrives at a strange, pyramid-shaped building. Squidward gets off the bus.
Squidward: Hello, Brother Roger.
Squidward and Brother Roger: [do secret hand-shake]
Brother Roger: Come right in, Brother Squidward.
Squidward: Thank you.
Lodge members: [talking]
Squidward: Ah. This almost makes the other three hundred and fifty-three days worth living for.
Lodge leader: For centuries, cephalapods have had but one nemesis. Let he among you who wishes to join the lodge face your greatest fear. Cantankerous Moray Eelius!
Lodge members: [Gasp!]
Cantankerous Moray Eelius: Huh?
New lodge member: [shivering while walking up to the moray eel's cage]
Squidward: I'll never forget my initiation ceremony.
New lodge member: [shivering]
Cantankerous Moray Eelius: [stings new lodge member]
Lodge members: [cheering]
Brother Roger: [puts lodge hat on new lodge member]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [clapping]
SpongeBob: Yeah! Way to go!
Patrick: Way to go!
Lodge members: [Gasp!]
Lodge leader: [Gasp!]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [clapping]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Patrick! Did you follow me here?
Lodge leader: Brother Squidward! For thousands of years, no outsiders have witnessed this sacred initiation! You have desecrated the sanctity of this lodge!
Squidward: But...but, I..I...I...I...
Squidward and SpongeBob: [get kicked out of lodge]
Squidward: I can't believe it. They kicked me out of the Cephalopod Lodge.
SpongeBob: Do we get to join the lodge?
Squidward: Were you dropped on your head when you were a baby?
SpongeBob: Huh! How did you know?
Squidward: Psychic powers. Hey! Where's Patrick?
SpongeBob: Maybe he got to join the lodge!
Patrick: [falls out of the sky and crushes Squidward]
SpongeBob: Or... maybe not. They didn't let you join either?
Patrick: Nah. I found the institution had nothing of to offer me. I was stagnating.
SpongeBob: Hey, where's Squidward?
Patrick: Hold on. [shakes right leg. Nothing happens. shakes left leg]
Squidward: [head pops out of Patrick's shorts]
Patrick: Found Squidward. [pulls Squidward out of his shorts. Then, pulls the hat out and puts it on Squidward's head]
Squidward: The last thing in my life I really enjoyed. And SpongeBob ruined it, too.
Patrick: Well, at least you still have the hat.
Squidward: Yeah. [sniffles] I do, don't I?
Brother Roger: Eh, hem. [takes Squidward's hat]
SpongeBob: You still have your robes.
Brother Roger: [takes Squidward's robes]
Patrick: You still have your underwear.
Brother Roger: [takes Squidward's underwear]
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: [covers his own eyes and Patrick's]
Squidward: [pulls on his regular shirt] You can look now.
SpongeBob: Don't you worry, Squidward. I'm sure if Patrick and I just explain what happened, they're sure to let you back in.
[knocks on Cephalopod Lodge door]
Brother Roger: What is it? Oh, it’s you two.
SpongeBob: We just came to explain that Squidward had no idea that we followed him to the lodge. So, it's not his fault.
Patrick: Yeah. Not his fault.
Brother Roger: Then who's fault was it?
Patrick: Was it my fault?
SpongeBob: No, it wasn't your fault, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks, SpongeBob. And it wasn't your fault either.
Brother Roger: Well, if it wasn't your fault, and it wasn't Squidward's fault, who's fault was it?
Patrick: Uh... maybe it's your fault.
Brother Roger: Squidward is never allowed in this lodge again!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Are they letting me back in the lodge?!
SpongeBob: No. You can't set foot in the lodge.
Patrick: Ever!
Squidward: Oh. Now that you two have ruined the last good thing in my life,...I think I'll go slam my head in the door. Repeatedly.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait! I'm sorry we got you kicked out of your lodge. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Squidward: No. Why didn't you just make up your own dumb club instead of ruining mine?
SpongeBob: That's it! [jumps on Squidward] Squidward! We'll make our own club! And it'll be so much better than that dumb old Cephalop-olaphapa Lodge! And you can be our leader! How great does that sound, O Mighty One?! Wanna join our club, Patrick?
Patrick: Dog-pile on Squidward!
Squidward: Aaahhhh! [The three walk back home].
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're the lodge expert. What do we do first?
Squidward: Say goodbye. [enters his house]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Goodbye!
Squidward: Morons.
SpongeBob: [climbs in through Squidward's window] So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation.
Patrick: [falls through Squidward's window] Hey.
SpongeBob: Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake.
Patrick: Secret!
SpongeBob: [claps hands over head]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Patty-cake, patty-cake, sailor man! Bake me a cake as fast...
Squidward: SpongeBob! That's not a secret hand-shake! Everybody knows Patty-cake!
SpongeBob: Not the way we do it.
Patrick: We don't use our pinkies.
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of his house] Out!
Patrick: I don't think Squidward wants to join our lodge.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure he does. He just needs a little push. [knocks on Squidward's door]
Squidward: Oh, what now? I'm coming! What do you... Great. Must be one of SpongeBob's pranks.
SpongeBob: [traps Squidward in a light brown bag] Let's move. [SpongeBob and Patrick carry the bag away]
They arrive at Jellyfish Fields.
SpongeBob: Okay, we can let him out now.
Squidward: Are you insane? You kidnapped me?
SpongeBob: Oh, we didn't kidnap you. We just brought you here for...
Patrick: Initiation.
Squidward: What? What kind of initiation?
SpongeBob: A very special initiation. [pulls a jellyfish out of his net]
Squidward: Oh, boy. Look at the time! Gotta run.
Patrick: [smashes Squidward to the ground]
SpongeBob: Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick?
Patrick: After you, Brother SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [flicks the jellyfish and puts it on his tongue] Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow! [gibberish] Brother Patrick?
Patrick: Brother SpongeBob. [slaps the jellyfish and puts it on his tongue] Aaahhhh! [gibberish] Brother Squidward? [pulls Squidward's tongue and puts the jellyfish on it]
Squidward: [jumps into the air] Eee-aahhhhhhh!
The next morning, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are all back at home.
Unknown person: [knocks on Squidward's door]
Squidward: What's this? Can it be? My lodge robes! I'm back in the lodge! I gotta try 'em on! [He comes out of his room, dressed in a chicken suit] Huh? This can't be right! These aren't my cephalopod robes!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling. They are in chicken suits, too.]
SpongeBob: They sure aren't. They're your uniform for your new lodge! Welcome to the first official meeting of...The Feather Friends.
Squidward: Feather Friends?
SpongeBob: Somebody already had Feather Buddies.
Patrick: Yeah. Those Feather Buddies better hope they don't run into us in a dark alley.
Squidward: Grrrr. [rips his chicken suit in half] I don't want to be a Feather Buddy!
SpongeBob: Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?
Squidward: Grrr...no.
SpongeBob: Aw...Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you. I'll get you back in that club. And I know just how to do it. [takes off his chicken suit] Everything we need is in this drawer. [pulls Squidward's sock out of the drawer]
Squidward: A sock?
SpongeBob: Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll have to let you back in the lodge!
Patrick: Hm. It's genius. But, I see one flaw in your plan.
Squidward: One flaw?
Patrick: That sock is way too small.
SpongeBob: It is. Time to break out the heavy artillery. [grabs a giant sock]
Patrick: That's what I'm talkin' about!
It is night time at the Cephalopod Lodge.
Albino eel (SpongeBob): Okay, Squidward. Just give us five minutes and then do your stuff.
Albino eel (SpongeBob and Patrick): [walk to the lodge]
Squidward: Huh.
Narrator: 5 minutes later...
Squidward: [walks to the lodge] This is ridiculous, No one is dumb enough to believe SpongeBob and Patrick are a..a....giant albino eel!
Lodge members: [screaming and running]
Patrick: Roooo!
SpongeBob: Roar!
Lodge members: [screaming and running]
Patrick: Roo!
SpongeBob: Roar!
Squidward: Unbelievable.
Lodge member: Squidward!
Brother Roger: Look out!
Lodge member: There's a giant albino eel on the loose!
Squidward: [clears throat] Do not worry. I will save you. Be gone, foul beast, or, I will smite thee. [punches the sock twice]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh! Oh, ow! Ow! Oof! [sock flattens and collapses]
Lodge members: [cheering] Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: [laughing]
Brother Roger: [gives Squidward his hat and robes]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [cheering]
SpongeBob: Way to go, Squidward.
Patrick: It works!
Squidward: Whoa!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: [get kicked out of lodge]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. We still have the Feather Friends.
Patrick: But you'll have to pass the initiation again.
Squidward: Aaah! No!
[Patrick grabs Squidward's tongue, so Squidward faces the screen. Fade out and we hear a sting. Squidward screams really loud]
Squidward: [screams]
Narrator: Shady Shoals, mild mannered rest home and secret headquarters of Mermaid Man, Master of maritime justice and defender of Bikini Bottom.
Mermaid Man: Semi-retired!
Narrator: And his faithful ward, Barnacle Boy.
Mermaid Man: Who?
Barnacle Boy: Hello.
Narrator: Today, we find this duo of dynamism engaged in their favorite pastime, watching TV.
[REMOTE! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy immediately fall asleep. NAP!]
Narrator: But wait, what's this? Why, it's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's biggest fans. SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star.
SpongeBob: Don't they look peaceful?
Patrick: Yeah... Wake up! [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy scream and jump off the couch]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Ahhhh!
Mermaid Man: I'll deal with these super villains with my trusty Mermarang!
Barnacle Boy: Hey, those aren't super villains.
[Mermaid Man throws his Mermarang at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mermai... [SpongeBob gets hit in the face with the Mermarang] Umph! I can't believe Mermaid Man hit me with his Mermarang... It's so awesome!
Patrick: Wow! [Turns to Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy] Can you beat me up next?
Mermaid Man: Keep on your guard, Barnacle Boy! They're getting ready for another attack!
Barnacle Boy: Those aren't super villains. It's just that kid, uh, SpongeBob and his goofy friend. Hey, kid, can you give us our Mermarang back? We only got the one.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing. [SpongeBob throws the Mermarang back to Barnacle Boy]
Barnacle Boy: Oh, don't throw... [He gets hit in the face with the Mermarang.. The Mermarang flies back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hey, It came back!
Barnacle Boy: Ya, it does that.
SpongeBob: I'll try again.
Barnacle Boy: No! Ahhh! Umph! Oh!
[Again, the Mermarang flies back to SpongeBob]
Barnacle Boy: Look, I'll just come and get... [SpongeBob throws the Mermarang again.. Barnacle Boy ducks down to avoid being hit again.. Barnacle Boy stands up once the Mermarang goes over his head]
Barnacle Boy: What is wrong with you? [Mermarang comes back and hits Barnacle Boy in the head again]
Mermaid Man: Nice shot!
Patrick: Wow! That Mermarang really likes you!
SpongeBob: I know!
Mermaid Man: Now just hand me the Mermarang, son. [SpongeBob, once again, throws the Mermarang, hitting Mermaid Man in the head]
SpongeBob: [Preparing to catch the Mermerang once again] I've got it! [The Mermarang flies past SpongeBob]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Runaway Mermarang!!!
[PANIC! All the old people start running around creating chaos.. The Mermarang hits Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy again. Both of them fall back on their couch and are dumped into the Mermalair. SpongeBob and Patrick follow]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Ahhhhh!
[They stand up and then SpongeBob and Patrick land onto them.. Pause. The Mermarang falls onto Barnacle Boy's head one last time. The heroes end up in the Bikini Bottom Hospital. Barnacle Boy is waking up and SpongeBob is right in his face] 
SpongeBob: Hi... How ya feeling?
Barnacle Boy: Would you get off of me?!
SpongeBob: Okay!
Barnacle Boy: [groans] What are you two doing here anyway?!
SpongeBob: Oh! I almost forgot! [Pulls flowers out of his head]
SpongeBob: I brought you flowers! [hands them to Barnacle Boy] Since you two are feeling so poorly.
Patrick: You never brought me flowers.
SpongeBob: Patrick, go home and check your mailbox.
Patrick: Really?
[Ring Ring]
Mermaid Man: The Mermaphone! [Picks up a tissue box] Mermaid Man here. [Phone rings again.. Mermaid Man picks up the real phone] Mermaid Man here! Ah, Commissioner! What can I do for you?
Commissioner: [what is heard] Bla bla bla, bla bla bla bla bla.
Mermaid Man: You can count on Mermaid Man, commissioner! [to Barnacle Boy] It's for you. [Hands the phone to him]
Barnacle Boy: Barnacle Boy here.
Commissioner: [what is heard] Bla bla bla, bla bla bla.
Barnacle Boy: Yes, but...
Commissioner: Bla bla bla bla.
Barnacle Boy: Yes, yes, commissioner... But, uh. [Click. The commissioner hangs up]
Barnacle Boy: The police commissioner needs us to be celebrity contestants at the Bikini Bottom Shuffle Boarding Competition. But there's no way we can do it in this condition!
Mermaid Man: What kind of quitter talk is that!? We're super heroes! We're going to that shuffle boarding competition, or my name isn't... [He raises his arm] Owww! You're right, Barnacle Boy, if only there was someone to take our place.
SpongeBob: [Biting his lip] Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... Patrick and I can do it, Mermaid Man!
Barnacle Boy: What? Why should we trust you two?
SpongeBob: Because, we're card carrying members of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fan club. [shows fan club card]
Barnacle Boy: So?
SpongeBob: We're also certified Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy impersonators. [turns the card around]
Patrick: Certified!
Mermaid Man: You can't argue with certification!
Barnacle Boy: Ohhhh... All right. I suppose they can't do too much damage. It's just shuffle boarding... umph!
[SpongeBob and Patrick both start jumping on Barnacle Boy].
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! We're going to be heroes! We're going to be heroes!
Patrick: Yay!
Barnacle Boy: Would you cut it out?!
Patrick: [Still jumping up and down] Heroes! Heroes! Her... [SpongeBob stops him] ...oes?
Barnacle Boy: Now, listen up! Here, take these rings.
[BLING! Dramatic music plays.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ohhhhhhhhhhh!
Barnacle Boy: And when you touch 'em together, you will be instantly transformed into our duplicates.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! [They put the rings together. RING! Music ends]
SpongeBob: [In Mermaid Man costume] We're ready! Man Bob!
Patrick: And Pat Boy!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Reporting for duty!
Barnacle Boy: When you're through with shuffle boarding, you are to bring those costumes right back here! And don't do anything else. Don't go home first, don't show your friends, just come right back here! You got it?!
SpongeBob: Got it!
Patrick: Got what?
Barnacle Boy: This'll never work.
Mermaid Man: What will never work?
[Later]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shuffle boarding, shuffle boarding, shuffle boarding ya woohoo! [Laughs]
SpongeBob: Shuffle boarding is exciting, huh, Patrick?
Patrick: Well, duh!
SpongeBob: What's your favorite thing about shuffle boarding?
Patrick: Everything! It's even fun just to say the word! Shee-uf-fle-boarde!
SpongeBob: Shu-ee-uu-ee-ufflelele-board! [Laughs] It is fun!
Patrick: We are seriously going to kick some elderly buns today! Huh, SpongeBob? [Elbows SpongeBob making him squeak]
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: [imagining] Out of the way gramps! That's my trophy old lady! [Patrick pretends to hit people with his shuffle boarding stick]
SpongeBob: Um, Patrick?
Patrick: It's going to be and action packed thrill ride of geriatric proportions! And the best part is, there is no way we can lose with these costumes on!
SpongeBob: We already won the tournament.
Patrick: Oh... ya, I forgot. [Pause] Well, how come I didn't get a trophy?!
SpongeBob: You did, it's in your back pocket.
Patrick: [Patrick looks behind him] Oh, yeah. I forgot. Well Let's go do something else.
SpongeBob: Okay.
[They start walking when SpongeBob remembers..]
Barnacle Boy: You are to bring those costumes right back here! Don't do anything else!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! Stop! [tries to stop Patrick by pushing his front body] We can't. We have to get the costumes back.
Patrick: For Neptune's sake, SpongeBob. If we're not going to go around town pretending to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, then who is?!
SpongeBob: Nobody?
Patrick: Exactly. And with no one patrolling the town, who's gonna stop those youngsters from loitering? [Shows two little kids playing on a seahorse ride]
SpongeBob: Their mommies?
Patrick: No! We are! Let's take 'em to the slammer!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Don't you think that's too harsh?
Patrick: Too harsh? [Shows the little kids being thrown into a jail cell] Explain.
Bikini Bottom Prison Guard: [Eating a Krabby Patty] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? What are you doing here? Ohhh. [Throws the half-eaten Krabby Patty away]
SpongeBob: [screaming] Wasting a Krabby Patty?! How could you?!
Bikini Bottom Prison Guard: [shrugs] I'm full.
[They throw the security guard into the jail cell.]
SpongeBob: Well, maybe somebody should have thought about that before they ponied up for the world's greatest patty! Mr. Jail Warden!
[SpongeBob and Patrick come out of the jail gates.]
SpongeBob: You're right, Patboy! This town needs us!
[Guy chewing on gum blows a bubble and it pops]
Patrick: You're chewing too loud! [Patrick throws him in jail. Man walking with his shoes untied]
SpongeBob: Your shoe's untied! [SpongeBob throws him in jail]
Patrick: You're too old! [Patrick throws Granny along with several other fish in the jail cell. Shows the outside of the jail getting bigger and bigger]
SpongeBob: Oh, I think we've done our work, Patrick. Now, let's return these costumes.
[SpongeBob sees Man Ray walking into a Laundromat.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] That's the evil Man Ray!
[Man Ray hums Sas he puts in some clothes in the washer. SpongeBob and Patrick are outside the window.] What diabolical plan could he be up to!?
Mable: Why,hello, Ray!
Man Ray: Mable! I haven't seen you since high school.
SpongeBob: Look at him, Patrick! Plotting with his evil minion!
Mable: Say, could I borrow some of your detergent?
Man Ray: Why certainly. Anything for the gal I went to the prom with.
SpongeBob: I'll bet he's handing off some secret weapon! Time to crash this party!
Mable: You haven't aged a day, Ray!
Man Ray: Nor you. [Laughs]
SpongeBob: Hello, Man Ray! Who's your friend?
Man Ray: Hey, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! I'd like you to meet Mable!
Mable: Any friend of Ray's is a friend of mine.
SpongeBob: Alright, Mable, that's enough chitchat! Now are you gonna come quietly, or will we have to take you to jail by force!?
[Everyone pauses for a second.]
SpongeBob: Playing dumb, eh?
Patrick: You handle Man Ray, I'll take care of his lackey. [Patrick tackles Mable]
Man Ray: Mable?!
SpongeBob: Hiiiiiii-ya! Eat dryer sheets, Man Ray!
Man Ray: Ahhhh! Grrrrrr... You! It's on now! Filthy shorts attack! [Flings underwear at SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Whooooaaaaa!
Man Ray: Clothes basket bombardment! [Shoves a basket over Patrick's head]
Patrick: Ohhhh!
Man Ray: Surrender! Mermaid Man? [SpongeBob throws a box at Man Ray] Ow! That's it! Time for the spin cycle! [Man Ray takes off his head and throws it spinning at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [gasp] Not so fast, Man Ray!
[SpongeBob opens a dryer door]
Man Ray: What?
SpongeBob: You're all wet, you need to dry out.
[SpongeBob closes the door and sets the dryer to shrink.]
Man Ray: Noooo! My head is dry clean only!
[After that, Man Ray's head has shrunk.]
Man Ray: [in tiny voice] But I didn't do anything.
SpongeBob: Just keep moving.
Patrick: You too, missy.
[SpongeBob and Patrick put them in Jail. The jail is bulging now]
SpongeBob: Well, our work is done here.
[The jail explodes. People land everywhere until the ambulance comes and carried away poor people and some of them saying “My leg!”]
At the Hospital
Mermaid Man: Good job, boys! You won the tournament and returned the costumes.
[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy raise their rings and the costumes are sucked up into the rings. SpongeBob and Patrick wheel Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy outside]
Mermaid Man: Thanks again, boys!
SpongeBob: Just doing our Mermaduty.
Patrick: [whispering] And then some.
SpongeBob: [laughs] And then some! [heh heh heh] That's a good one!
Mermaid Man: Goodbye, young men! Oh, look! We have more visitors!
[all chanting madly and angrily..]
Mermaid Man: Looking good, Man Ray!
[All start to close in. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are wheeling, in their wheelchairs, as fast as they can]
Barnacle Boy: Faster, you ol’ coot!
SpongeBob: [crowd yelling and chasing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy] They have so many fans! [crowd yelling and still chasing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy at sunset.]
Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick! Here I come! [runs and leaps over Patrick]
Patrick: Nice landing! [rolls, leaps and lands on his head and hands] Darn, I missed! SpongeBob, look out for my body! [They both fall off a mountain and land on a nest.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!
Patrick: Ball! Let me see it! [a ball turns itself into a worm] What a weird ball.
SpongeBob: Well, who knows how long it ... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!
Patrick: There's nothing to be afraid of, SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See?
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest little worm. I promise it won't happen again. [the worm rubs its head on SpongeBob's hand] Look, Patrick!
Patrick: Looks like he's taking a fancy to you.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back.
Patrick: That sounds delightful! [cuts to scene where SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at SpongeBob's place.]
SpongeBob: Gary! [knocks the door] Make yourself descent. [laughs] You have a visitor. [Gary went to sleep, then wakes up.] Gary, wake up [opens the door, whispered] Patrick, just bring in here, careful now, that's right.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley. [shows Mr. Wormsely, then Gary hissed at him and Mr. Wormsley barks at him, they start to growl at each other.]
Patrick: Something tells me they don't like each other.
SpongeBob: Come on, now. Guys, come on. Let's touch soft parts in a friendly manner. See? You're just saying hi. That's it. There you go, that's it. Oh, I knew you could get along. There, there you go. See? Friends. [Gary attacks SpongeBob.] OW! Oh my goodness! Patrick, please do something. Aaaaaaaaaahhh.......
Patrick: SpongeBob, I gotta get going. See you later now.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, see you later then. [SpongeBob trips at Mr. Wormsely.] Aaaaaaaahhhh......
[Cut to the scene tonight]
SpongeBob: All right, Gary, so there isn't more upset, you're going to sleep at the guest newspaper tonight, while Mr. Wormsley is sleeping here with me. [Gary growls at Mr. Wormsely. SpongeBob picks him up.] Now, now, Gary don't be rude. [SpongeBob opens the door. And turns on the lights.] See? I set it all nice just for you. There you are. [SpongeBob leaves.] Good night, Gary. [SpongeBob closes the door.]
Gary: Meow
[Cut to the scene next morning.]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is seen sleeping. Waking up because of some howling.] Must have been Patrick is doing his night fits again. Okay I'll just close the window. [Still hears some howling.] Mr. Wormsley! [SpongeBob takes off the newspaper revealing him mourning, and a big belly, meaning he's giving birth.] Woaaaaahh! I'll be right back, Mr. Wormsley. I'm gonna go get help. Whatever's wrong with you, don't move!
[Cut to the scene later with Patrick.]
SpongeBob: He's in here. [Patrick enters the door.] Oh! I can't watch!
Patrick: SpongeBob, something tells me that Mr. Wormsley is actually a Mrs. Wormsley. [shows baby worms]
SpongeBob: Oh! Patrick, it’s a miracle.
Patrick: That it is.
SpongeBob: Wait 'till Gary sees.
Patrick: Yeah! Wait 'till.
SpongeBob: Here, Gary, right in here. They're gone asleep.
[Mrs. Wormley and Gary are growling each other again. Gary and Mrs. Wormsley fighting. Until outside of conch street.]
Gary: Meow, Meow, Meow.
[Mrs. Wormsley is now riding a bus.]
SpongeBob: He's chased her away! Now, who will care for her abandoned newborn infants?
Patrick: Maybe you could take care of them.
SpongeBob: I dunno, Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset. I guess we'll just have to find homes for each and every one of them. Right, Pat? Patrick? [Patrick is gone]
[cuts to SpongeBob at Squidward's house]
Squidward: [opens door, yawning] SpongeBob? Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning?
SpongeBob: How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms?
Squidward: Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the—huh?
SpongeBob: Baby worms.
Squidward: [glances into the box holding the worms] [one oozes green glistening slime on Squidward's face]
SpongeBob: So, how many did you want? [Squidward shuts the door in SpongeBob's face] [cuts to Mrs Puff's house]
Mrs. Puff: Yes? Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. What are you, uh, doing here? And not that the teacher's most enthusiastic student isn't welcome in her house. [notices SpongeBob still ringing the doorbell and sighs. SpongeBob looks down at the ground and finally lets go of the doorbell.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: It almost was.
SpongeBob: Would you like a baby worm?
Mrs. Puff: A what? [screams. Inflates her body to break some of her house in pieces]
SpongeBob: Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day!
Mrs. Puff: [house collapses] I hate Mondays.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you. [cuts to supermarket] Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some... [lady just keeps walking] Ma'am? [Larry comes out of the Supermarket whistling] That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to?
Larry: Do I know you?
SpongeBob: Probably not.
Larry: I was just picking up some dietary supplements here at the supermarket. I've been working on my chest... and buns.
SpongeBob: So I see.
Larry: Well, catch you later.
SpongeBob: Oh, Larry, wait.
Larry: No time now. Somewhere, there's sand that needs kicking.
SpongeBob: Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms.
Larry: Baby worms?
SpongeBob: Well, yeah!
Larry: I'll take them off your hands.
SpongeBob: Really?
Larry: Sure, why not? That's just what the nutritionist ordered: raw protein! [is about to eat the worms]
SpongeBob: Larry, no! [jumps into Larry's stomach, knocking him down and sending the box flying]
Larry: Dude, nice hustle.
[The box lands in the middle of an intersection, with an 18-wheeler headed straight for it. SpongeBob lets out a bloodcurdling scream, flails his arms and babbles incoherently. Larry launches SpongeBob into the air with his abs and he lands on the hood of the truck. He slides down, pulls the vent apart, and crawls inside. He pulls out three plugs, then peeks outside. The truck is still going. Then he notices a loose screw. He unscrews it completely with a wrench, causing the engine to fall out of the bottom of the truck and the truck to stop completely, in the nick of time.]
SpongeBob: Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe. Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised. [the phone rings] Hello?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, it's Mr. Krabs. I've been looking all over for you. You're three hours late for work! [SpongeBob screams] Hello?
SpongeBob: [runs into the Krusty Krab out of breath] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could--
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape?
SpongeBob: [pants] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live.
Mr. Krabs: Babies?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Let me see.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, come on, let me see them. I like babies.
SpongeBob: Well, okay.
Mr. Krabs: [in baby talk] Hey there, little critters. [looks inside the box] Come to... [one of the worms spits green bile onto his face]
SpongeBob: Oh, he likes you.
Mr. Krabs: [very angry] Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto! [SpongeBob is shocked by this reaction, and runs out of the Krusty Krab sobbing] Blech! [bubble transition to the back of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [inside a garbage can with the worms, depressed] Oh, well. At least I still have you guys. [gets sprayed on by the worms as a garbage truck drives up and stops]
Garbage Fish #1: Hmm... [removes some goo from SpongeBob's face with two fingers and sniffs it]
Garbage Fish #2: What is it?
Garbage Fish #1: I'd recognize this goo anywhere. It comes from a baby spotted glistening meadow worm, the rarest of its species.
Garbage Fish #2: Dude, those things are worth a fortune.
Mr. Krabs: Did you say "fortune?" [His eyes show dollar symbols] [later, Mr. Krabs is talking through a megaphone and trying to sell worms] $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks.
Female fish: These things are so cute! [hands some money to Mr. Krabs and receives back a worm]
SpongeBob: Enjoy your new home, little guy.
Female fish: Isn't he just adorable? [gets sprayed on by her new baby worm. She laughs, the crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. I've never been to the old country! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both laugh, ending the episode]
Plankton: Oh, come on, Karen, please!
Karen: Well, if you must know...
Plankton: [interrupting] There's nothing wrong with Chum Bucket fare. Why, look! Here's a fresh batch of a delicious new chum sauce. It's called Spicy Chum Surprise. [Shows sauce melting through pan and onto floor where it then starts to melt through the floor] [Pause] Delectable!
Karen: [sarcastically] Oh, I'm sure it'll be a huge success!
[Siren]
Plankton: Sorry, no time for your senseless chatter. I've got a customer to attend to!
[Ding Ding]
Billy: Okay, so what about the Krabby Kola?
Plankton: We don't serve Krabby Kola, we carry Bucket Bubbler and Chum Cherry Blast.
Billy: Okay, well then, can I just make sure I get those Krabby Fries with extra Krabby Sauce?
Plankton: [frustrated] Ugh! How many times must I say it?! We don't carry Krabby Fries, we don't carry Krabby Kola, we don't carry Krabby Sauce, and we don't carry Krabby Patties! So, if you want any of those things, you're gonna have to go to the Krusty Krab, which is located directly across the street!
Billy: Okay, thanks for the directions.
Plankton: [annoyed] Any time. What is wrong with people?! Honestly, I don't think anyone in Bikini Bottom would know a decent meal if it looked them right in the eye and said, "Hello! I'm a decent meal, wonderful to meet you! Please pay money for me and then put me in your mouth so your old pal Plankton doesn't lose everything he's spent his entire life working for!"
Karen: Yeah, and if anyone ever did order one of your meals, it probably would look them in the eye.
Plankton: You know, Karen, sometimes I wonder if you're here to help me run the Chum Bucket or just to make me feel like I'm two inches tall. [Notices ruler right next to where he is standing showing he is indeed two inches tall]
Karen: Maybe in heels. If it wasn't for me, you probably wouldn't even remember to blink!
Plankton: Oh, come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today! [Pause] Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow!
Karen: What's the matter?
Plankton: My eye is burning and I don't know why!
Karen: Blink.
Plankton: [blinks] Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Now where was I!?
Karen: You were threatening to replace me.
Plankton: Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula!
Karen: Oh, puh-leeze.
Plankton: I'll show you woman! [Marches away]
[Later]
Plankton: Oh, Karen!
[Shows Karen watching a computer movie]
Karen: Now what!?
Plankton: Could you come here for a moment?
[Karen rolls in to the kitchen]
Karen: What do you want?
Plankton: Feast your, uh, screen on this. [Presses red button]
[Contraption rolls out]
Karen: That’s my replacement!? It’s a toaster!
Plankton: Ha ha ha, that, my dear, is a T-119A Compumatic, the finest of its kind.
T-119A Compumatic: Good morning, sir.
Plankton: Good morning, T-119A!
[robot short circuits]
Plankton: They're supposed to do that. [another robot is revealed] Next, behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power! And refinement.
[Robot tries to come through the doorway but can't, making the glass top break] [Water squirts everywhere]
Karen: [Sarcastically] That'll help you get the formula.
Plankton: And now, Karen, the piece de resistance. [shows robot] Have you ever witnessed such marvelous machinery?
Karen: It sorta just looks like an old hair dryer taped to the back of a miniature windmill.
Plankton: I can see how someone of your level of technical knowledge would think that, Karen, but in actuality what you are looking at is... oh, right.
Karen: I don't recall you ever having reason to own a hair dryer, Plankton.
Plankton: Okay, here we go! Are you going to make me get the picture down again!?
Karen: What picture!?
[Plankton walks down hallway and takes picture off the wall]
[Shows Karen wedding picture of the two of them. Plankton has a full head of hair]
Plankton: You see! Plenty of reason to be using a hair dryer.
Karen: Why are we even talking about this?
Plankton: Because you were the one that said—
[interrupted by torch sounding noises]
Karen: What's going on!?
Plankton: Dear Neptune!
[Shows robots attacking each other]
[Plankton tries to separate robots]
Plankton: Karen, do something! Quick! They're tearing each other apart! Just press a button or something!
[Karen presses the red button Plankton had been using]
Plankton: Not that one!
[Siren sounds]
[Plankton screams as a panel in SPU-31 flips open to reveal a hammer. It immediately targets Plankton and smashes him three times. Plankton walks back up to Karen, smushed.]
Karen: Well, it's good to see that that strategy didn't fall flat!
Plankton: You know, Karen, with you around, I'm beginning to wonder how I'm still alive.
Karen: Ohhh, so it's my fault is it?
Plankton: That's right! Now it's all clear! It's you that's been holding me back! In fact, if it weren't for your constant stifling, I'd have the whole world running for the safety of their mommies!
Karen: You and your crack team of robots, huh?
[Shows robots again beating each other up]
Plankton: Well maybe I could iron out a few bugs, but then you'll see just how much I need you! [looks around] Karen? What's this? [Sees note on the ground] It's words on paper. It says: "Dear Plankton, I've logged onto another network. I just can't go into sleep mode at night knowing that you'll continue blaming me for all of your failures. Anyway, you're a grown single celled organism, and allowed to make your own syntax errors. Nice knowing you, Karen." Dah! who needs her!? Not me! I'm going to steal that Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs once and for all. And then we'll see who's made the error. [Laughs menacingly] Ow! [looks at note] "P.S., don't forget to blink." Oh yeah. [blinks]
[Later]
Plankton: Okay, team, listen up. We're on our own now so we don't have anything holding us back. Now I know you all look upon me kindly since I am your creator, but the last thing the Chum Bucket needs is, if we're going to be victorious, is a bunch of soft, uh, software. Does everybody understand?
[All robots but one make their noise of recognition]
Plankton: I said, does everybody understand!?
[Last robot makes noise of recognition]
Plankton: All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position! [Shows robot fly through the air] SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position!
[Shows Plankton in the command module]
Plankton: Heh heh heh. Now let's see Krabs stop this. I'll show him. I'll show them all!
[Plankton laughs menacingly again]
Perch Perkins: This just in, a diabolical albeit haphazardly thrown-together machine is attacking Bikini Bottom and is headed straight for the Krusty Krab! [click]
[Squidward turns off the TV at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Why is the local news always such rubbish!?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket.
Squidward: SpongeBob, nobody cares about... [interrupted by rumbling and shaking]
[Plankton's robot silhouette is seen in the dust approaching the Krusty Krab]
[Plankton laughs menacingly]
[Propeller from his windmill hits his head knocking off his hat]
Plankton: Hey! Krabs, I wanna see you.
[Mr. Krabs ducks down in the window]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, get out there. [Throws SpongeBob outside towards Plankton's robot]
SpongeBob: Um... hello... what do you want robot thing, sir? [Plankton walks out on a boardwalk] Oh, hey Plankton! What are you doing here?
Plankton: I'm here for the secret formula you twit! Now I want you to go in there and tell Krabs that if he doesn't turn over the formula to me, that he'll be subjected to utter annihilation at my... Are you getting this?
SpongeBob: Uhhhhh, uuh uuh.
Plankton: Uuhhhh, moron! Okay, I'll make it simple: Krabs give me secret formula or I bring big boom boom to Krusty Krab. Got it?
SpongeBob: [Writing on clipboard] Krabs give me secret formula or... uhhh... what was that other thing?
Plankton: [Frustrated] Uhhh! Forget it! [Marches back into his command module, drops SpongeBob] Bring on the Boom Boom!
[Planktons laugh]
[Robot starts marching toward the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Battle stations men! Here he comes!
SpongeBob: We're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed!
Squidward: [Walking out of the Krusty Krab] Later.
[Robot marching again with Plankton] [You notice that the extension cord that is powering the robot is about to be unplugged]
[Robot stops only feet from the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: Hey, what gives?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs emerge from the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs laughed at Plankton's failed attempt and the two walked away. ]
[Robot collapses]
Plankton: [Crying] Oh curse you cruel fate. Once again, you've left me covered in the sticky goo of my own folly. Only this time, I'm all alone. [More crying]
Karen: Ahem.
Plankton: [Looks up and sees Karen] Karen! You've come back to me!
Karen: Actually, I just came to get my keyboard.
Plankton: Oh, I knew you couldn't stay away, I knew it!
Karen: [sigh] Let me guess, another failure?
Plankton: What you gonna do, machines these days, right? Umm, listen sweetie, I'm sorry about what I said. Truth is, I could never replace you honey-bunch. Lets go home hun?
Karen: [sigh] Okay.
Plankton: Hey, I could whip us up a little dinner, what do ya say?
Karen: Do you want me to leave you again?
Plankton: Or we could go out! [Karen mumbles something]
SpongeBob: [knocks on Patrick's rock] Get up, Patrick! It's time! [rock opens up]
Patrick: [barely waking up] Time for what?
SpongeBob: The big shin-dig! Remember?
Patrick: No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today. [wiggles his foot]
SpongeBob: That's shin dig, buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship.
Patrick: The beach! Just you and me!? [SpongeBob rips off his pants showing his swim trunks; Patrick rips off his skin showing his insides] So am I ready for the beach, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine! [bubble transition to a bus coming by. SpongeBob and Patrick shove a huge bag of stuff onto it] I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend. [shoves his bag onto a seat with someone sitting in the seat. SpongeBob and Patrick both cram themselves on the same seat along with the guy]
Guy on Bus: You're hurting me!
SpongeBob: [taps the guy in front of him on the shoulder (Harold)] Guess what?
Person in front of him (Harold): [sigh] What?
SpongeBob: I'm going to the beach with my best friend! [taps the bus driver's shoulder] Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!
Bus driver:  What?
SpongeBob: Okay, out of everybody on this bus, guess which one is my best friend?
Bus driver: I don't care.
SpongeBob: You know what this situation calls for. Patrick! [SpongeBob takes out a keyboard guitar, and Patrick takes out an accordion] A few verses of the best friend tune! [SpongeBob and Patrick start playing and singing]♪Ohhhh best fr-♪ [the bus stops and SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked off it] Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are.
Patrick: I knew it! We've been abandoned!
SpongeBob: No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here! [Patrick sobbing]
Volleyball player: [hits SpongeBob in the head with a volleyball] A little help, bro?
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out! [turns around and his pants appear to be sagging. Reaches in his pants and takes out a Frisbee] It's a small plastic disc that you throw!
Patrick: Small plastic disc that you throw! [claps] I love to play... small plastic disc that you throw!
SpongeBob: I do, too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name.
Patrick: Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?
SpongeBob: Perfect! Now run along, Patrick, and I'll [winks] toss it to you!
Patrick: [runs] Ha ha ha ha.
SpongeBob: Ready?! [throws Frisbee. Patrick is running and laughing. He steps on two people and kicks sand in a guy's sandwich]
Nat: Ha ha ha! That's why they call it a sandwich! [Patrick kicks sand in his mouth while trying to catch the Frisbee. He almost runs into a pane of glass being carried by two workers. He crashes through an ice cream cart, and then into a lifeguard tower]
Patrick: [Underneath rubble of the life guard tower, Frisbee lands in his hand] I caught it! [Pants] Wasn't that cool, SpongeBob?
Life Guard: [pops out from underneath the tower rubble] I can assure you, that was not cool! Just look at what you've done! Your buffoonery has destroyed the lifeguard tower! Why don't you find something to do that's less obnoxious?
Patrick: Like what?
Life Guard: I don't know, go play in the sand or something!
Patrick: Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring.
SpongeBob: Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or...
Patrick: Boring, SpongeBob, boring!
SpongeBob: I know, we can make sand castles!
Patrick: That sounds [elbows SpongeBob] un-boring!"
SpongeBob: No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle. [Laughs. Bubble transition to him constructing a sand castle. SpongeBob talks to the man he has drawn in a window of his castle] Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy? [To Patrick] How ya doing over there?
Patrick: [patting sand] Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom.
SpongeBob: Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over. [begins rubbing down Patrick's sand mound]
Patrick: Whoa! What are you doing!? You destroyed my castle!
SpongeBob: I'm just trying to help, buddy!
Patrick: Well, I don't need any help.
Patrick's Architect: Here are those architectural plans you requested.
Patrick: Why thank you. Here's a little something for you." [hands architect sand money which promptly disintegrates in his hands]
SpongeBob: Well, I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm. [to the little man in his sand castle] And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side.
Patrick: [throws a ball of sand at SpongeBob's castle, destroying it] Now, we're even!
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick, have it your way. [Draws a line in the sand separating the two of them] "You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine. [mumbles to himself and quickly builds an even larger and better castle]
Patrick: ['looks at his plans] Now, this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! Let's see SpongeBob destroy this castle! [builds a castle with spikes on top and a skull and crossbones symbol on the door]
SpongeBob: [After seeing Patrick's new castle] I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas. [starts building a wall, but then notices that Patrick's castle is over the borderline] Oh, sir, you built onto my side.
Patrick: So?
SpongeBob: [mad] So, you don't do that! [chops off the portion of Patrick's castle that is crossing] There! That restores the integrity of our shared border.
Patrick: You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for! [Builds a hammer out of sand and charges toward SpongeBob's castle]
SpongeBob: But what for what!?
Patrick: [attacks SpongeBob's castle, completely destroying it] Now, we're even... again!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again. [builds this huge castle and Patrick does the same. Bubble transition to SpongeBob blowing a medieval horn] I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms. [Patrick signs SpongeBob's sand made treaty] Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!" [Patrick shoots a sand arrow at SpongeBob's castle] What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?
Patrick: This treaty isn't worth the sand it's printed on! [Treaty disintegrates]
SpongeBob: Oh, is that so!?" Well, if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is bring it on! [Patrick laughs and builds an army of knights. SpongeBob clears his throat] Patrick, I'm trying to be the nice guy here, okay? Let's call this silly business off.
Patrick: No way! You started it.
SpongeBob: Fine! Have it your way.
Patrick: [laughs menacingly] Whatever. [SpongeBob is loading a catapult] No no no no no. [SpongeBob chops the catapult rope. Patrick screams as the sand rocks from SpongeBob's catapult hurl toward him destroying Patrick's army. SpongeBob laughs and blows another horn. SpongeBob's army emerges from his castle and charges toward Patrick. Patrick screams again. SpongeBob's army starts to ram down the door to Patrick's castle. Patrick panics and builds a cannon. SpongeBob's army breaks the door] Oh hello! And goodbye. [pulls cannon's string. SpongeBob's army rushes in his castle away from the cannonball]
SpongeBob: Come on! [closes the door to his castle] How do you like them apples [Cannonball goes over the wall and destroys the army]
Patrick: [laughs from atop his castle] You'll never win! Do you hear me!?
SpongeBob: [now inside a high tech sand castle] Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put, general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you? [Sand constructed general starts to fall apart] Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately! [builds a tank that then crashes through his own castle and towards Patrick's] How do you like me now?
Patrick: [has a robot already built that punches through his own castle] I like you this much! [picks up SpongeBob's tank with SpongeBob screaming inside] Feel me!
SpongeBob: [screams again. He presses a button in his tank blowing up Patrick's robot. He emerges from his tank and sees Patrick inside his robot head] Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?
Patrick: [quietly] The question is... will you be!? [presses a button in his robot head. The robot flies into the air with SpongeBob still hanging on. SpongeBob looks down and sees how high up he is. He then slips and falls through the sky. Then he pulls a sand parachute and laughs] No fair!
SpongeBob: [Floating gently down] All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!? [presses a sand button. Falls into his jet waiting in midair. SpongeBob presses a button in his jet while chasing Patrick's robot head] Now let's have some real fun! [Missiles fly toward Patrick. Patrick screams as he turns his robot away from the missiles]
Beach Onlooker: [to the person next to him] What was that!? Come on, we got to get out of here! [More people on the beach scream and run away]
Patrick: [calm now] Oh, yeah? Two can play at this game! [Presses button. Patriot missiles emerge from the ground and fly toward SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [seeing the missiles] Jumping jellyfish! WHOA! [Turns the plane down, does a loop, and crashes the missiles into Patrick's castle. SpongeBob laughs. Patrick's robot meets SpongeBob's in the air]
Patrick: I wasn't going to do this, but you've left me no choice. [Patrick drops an atomic bomb on SpongeBob's castle]
Gryphon: [gasps] Let's beat it, dude! [He and another gryphon fly away as the bomb explodes. Patrick laughs menacingly. Patrick is interrupted by SpongeBob flying his jet directly toward Patrick. Patrick screams loudly. SpongeBob's jet crashes into Patrick's robot]
SpongeBob: [laying on the ground in pain] Ohhhh.
Patrick: [also laying on the ground in pain] Ohhhh. What happened?
SpongeBob: I'll tell you what happened, Patrick... I got carried away.
Patrick: Me, too...was it worth it?
SpongeBob: No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson. [SpongeBob and Patrick hug]
Lifeguard: Let's also not forget who's going to clean this place up. [camera pans around showing the destruction caused]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Oooh, uhhhh, ahhhh...
Lifeguard: [gives Patrick a dustpan and hands SpongeBob a broom] Better get started! You've got a lot of work to do.
Patrick: I bet I can clean up faster than you!
SpongeBob: Oh yeah? I bet you can't!
Patrick: Yes, I can!
SpongeBob: No, I can!
Patrick: Oh, I can!
SpongeBob: I can!
Patrick: Hey, look at this!
SpongeBob: ♪La La La La La La La La! Getting clean! La La La La La doo doo doo! Oh, what a delightful day it is to get...♪ [soap slips out of SpongeBob's hands] Noooooo! [Soap lands on the ground far away from the shower] Good thing I have a spare. [opens a new bar of soap] I still have one more thing to clean! [sticks soap through his ear and he washes his brain. His brain gets clean, and smiles. He gets out of shower and slips through his wringer] Oh, what would I do without you, wringer? Guess I'd be all wet! [laughs and gets dressed] And now I'm ready to go to work! [slips on soap, screams, and then gets up off ground] You've got to be more careful, SquarePants! [spare bar of soap falls on the floor] Always gotta be watching out for... things. Things like... [notices soap]... that! Oh, I saw you. Not going to fool me this time, soap. [soap frowns. Then SpongeBob steps on a rubber duckie. He jumps back onto the soap, slipping him in his wringer. He tries to escape] This is not going well.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, have you seen my rubber duckie?
SpongeBob: Oh, is that it?
Patrick: I found you! Duckie Duck! [laughs] Quack, quack, quack!
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick?
Patrick: Huh...
SpongeBob: I hate to interrupt your reunion, but I kind of need your help over here.
Patrick: What do you need, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, I'm a little stuck, if you know what I mean.
Patrick: Stuck? I can help with that. [reaches for a bottle marked "Forever Glue" and applies it to the wringer] There you go, buddy. Now you're stuck forever!
SpongeBob: Gee, thanks, Patrick! Now I'm stuck for- fe, fe, fe, forever?! [when the glue starts to dry SpongeBob tries to escape, but it's too late. The glue has dried, and SpongeBob is unable to get himself free] Patrick, I wanted to get un-stuck, not more stuck! How am I going to get to work when I'm stuck here forever? Must get out of Wringer! [SpongeBob uses his eyes, nose and mouth to get out of the wringer, but he gets pulled back and screams]
Patrick: [breaks wringer off of the ground] There, is that better?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. It isn't. How am I supposed to flip patties like this?
Patrick: Okay, you know what, SquarePants? That's quitter talk. And are you a quitter?
SpongeBob: No.
Patrick: And are you going to let this wringer get between you and your passion? [a flag with a Krabby Patty on it appears behind them] Those sweet tomatoes, crisp onions. Are you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No. I'm won't let it get between me and those crisp onions, sweet tomatoes, fresh lettuce, a flame-broiled patty, a warm bun sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with a smile that says, "Hey! I can!" I'm ready!
Patrick: That's the spirit!
SpongeBob: Woo! [crashes into door and falls down the stairs] Don't worry, Patrick! My spirits are still high!
[cut to the Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob uses a spatula attached to the wringer, and kicks the box of toppings to land on the patty]
SpongeBob: Hello, perfectly made Krabby Patty. Order's up!
Squidward: It's about time. [he notices SpongeBob, who has put the bottle of mustard in one of his holes, and laughs at him] Hey, SpongeBob, love the outfit. Where'd you get it, the hardware store?! [laughs] Hardware store!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Hardware store! No, from my bathroom.
Squidward: Well, I must say, it really completes your imbecile look. Way to go, buddy. [gives himself thumbs up and winks]
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, pal. [he returns the thumbs up and accidentally squirts mustard into Squidward's eyes, causing him to scream in pain, and his eyes to shrivel off and fall on the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Ohh! Squidward! [Squidward falls in the cashier station] Squidward! [jumps on Squidward's stomach] Are you okay?
Squidward: Please, just get away from me.
Customer: Excuse me, can I have a refill on my soda?
SpongeBob: Ohh! A refill! [hits cash register, which falls on customer's foot]
Customer: Oww! Oh, my foot! Oh, my foot! [bumps into table] Ow! My back! [bumps into table] My face!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing-- [hits cash register, which opens and spews money everywhere] Whoa! [smashes into a pole] Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok- [screams after seeing customers taking the money] Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his office] Me money! What do you think you're doing? [he snatches money from a customer] That ain't yours. [He does it again] Thank you very much. When I get my hands on that boy... [SpongeBob struggles to get out of the pole, blasts out, exclaims, crashes into Mr. Krabs and the other customers]
SpongeBob: Here, Mr. Krabs. I'll help.
Mr. Krabs: [shouts] Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today. [shows destroyed restaurant and he takes SpongeBob outside] And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone! [throws SpongeBob out of the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how was work?
SpongeBob: Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack. [a kid chains his bike to the wringer. SpongeBob starts crying]
Patrick: Hey! Don't you go crying on me! [uses a hair dryer to dry SpongeBob's teary eyes] Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better.
[cut to Super Weenie Hut Jr.'s]
SpongeBob: You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!
Patrick: Dig in!
SpongeBob: [he tries to eat ice cream, but can't because his hands are stuck in the wringer, so he uses his tongue but he can't swallow it] I can't even eat ice cream now! This dumb wringer's in the way!
Patrick: Bummer. Hey, you know what? Forget this place. Let's go to the carnival. That's the funnest spot in the ocean. [then he eats SpongeBob's ice cream. Cut to the carnival]
Patrick: Look! The ball toss!
Ball Toss Vendor: Step right up, folks! Toss a ball, hit the cans, and win a stuffed seahorse!
Patrick: We want to play!
Ball Toss Vendor: Sure. Give me your best shot. [hands Patrick some balls]
Patrick: Thanks. [throws ball and knocks down all of the cans] Woohoo! [to SpongeBob] Now you try.
SpongeBob: [throws ball as best he can. It bounces back and hits SpongeBob in the face, and he gets a nasty black eye]
Patrick: Ohh! Oh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we got to do that!
SpongeBob: I don't know... I have too much eye pain.
Patrick: Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?! [they walk away revealing a sign that says "Carnival Always Here". Then they get into one of the seats in the ride] Ready?
SpongeBob: [struggles to reach the handle, but it's too late, the ride already starts and SpongeBob is flung out of the ride]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [flying through the air] Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!
[cut to later in the day at the carnival]
Patrick: Hey, pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this, too! [shows off his ribbon pin] Check it out!
SpongeBob: That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy.
Patrick: Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.
SpongeBob: [his patience has run out] I said I don't want any! [turns and knocks it onto the ground]
Patrick: You ruined my cotton candy!
SpongeBob: Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!
Ball Toss Vendor: Check it out! Public fight!
Other Vendor: Working at the carnival sure has its perks! [crowd gathers around SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: I have never felt so ashamed.
Patrick: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!
Patrick: I was only trying to help.
SpongeBob: [shouts] Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today! [This is the exact same thing Mr. Krabs said earlier]
Patrick: Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore! [As Patrick runs off in tears, the crowd looks mad at SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one.
Sandals: You know, kid, your body isn't the problem. It's your heart. [inside SpongeBob's body, his heart starts to groan sadly] You deserve what you've gotten. Come on, we're out of here. [the angry crowd leaves, listening to what the humanized fish says] Some people are just born mean. [SpongeBob frowns in shame]
[cut to Patrick's Rock]
Patrick: [his rock opens to reveal him brushing his teeth] Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him. [brushes his armpit, then his belly button, then puts the toothbrush back in his mouth] I can do whatever I want! [then eats the toothbrush and screams; he gets off his rock] I don't need him. [looks at SpongeBob's house and almost calls for SpongeBob to come out, but stops himself] Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge-- [stops and covers his mouth] I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest! [stares off into space, then blinks and a tumbleweed rolls by] Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard.
Patrick in a Thought Bubble: Maybe if SpongeBob was here, he could give you pointers.
Patrick: Who asked you?! [claps the thought bubble away] Forget it! I'll just play...uh... fetch! [throws stick, which lands on SpongeBob's doorstep] Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha! [pauses, puts his ear to SpongeBob's door] Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help. [walks away, but then runs back] Buddy! [throws door off hinges] Uhh! SpongeBob? [SpongeBob has stubble and is sitting in the darkened living room] SpongeBob? Hey, what are you watching?
SpongeBob: [in chair watching TV, in a trance] My favorite show. [shows static on the TV. Then the TV dies] Ha, ha, I love that part!
Patrick: SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!
SpongeBob: What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head.
Patrick: Oh, man, he's too far gone.
SpongeBob: Not fit to live in society...
Patrick: [crying] This is all my fault! [holds up his Forever Glue] Me and my dumb ideas! I'm so sorry! [A tear falls from his eye and runs down SpongeBob's arm, and lands on the dried glue on the wringer. The tear melts the glue and SpongeBob is able to pull his arm out]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing! [Both start crying, and all of the glue melts off. He then pulls himself out of the wringer] Look! It worked!
SpongeBob and Patrick: All right! [SpongeBob throws the wringer up in the air]
SpongeBob: [to the viewers] I guess crying does solve your problems after all. [to Patrick] Come here, buddy! [SpongeBob and Patrick hug. The wringer falls down, trapping SpongeBob and Patrick in it]
Patrick: Well, at least we're together! Heh. Hey, should I get the glue?
Mr. Krabs: [turns off lights, lights a cigar, and bathes in money] Ahh, that's the stuff. [sniffs] Hey, something don't smell right. SpongeBob! Hey, what are you burning out here, boy?
SpongeBob: [sniffs] Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.
Mr. Krabs: Explosive!? [Scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where Plankton is flying on a glider laughing evilly]
Plankton: Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene! [activates bomb, which blows up roof]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!
Plankton: You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!
Mr. Krabs: Ready ammunition! [SpongeBob takes off his hat and it reveals a peas can. Krabs opens the can with his claw and he pours all the peas into SpongeBob. He then uses SpongeBob as a gun] Fire! [SpongeBob shoots pass at Plankton. The peas shoot through Plankton's air glider. But Plankton blows a bubble over himself causing the peas to be deflected. The deflected peas hits the frying pans. One of the frying pans fall and hits SpongeBob. Plankton then fires a missile at them] Take cover! [Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and uses him as a shield, but the missile just fall straight to the ground] Oh, ha, ha, it didn't blow up! Another dud, Plankton.
Plankton: Another dud huh? [He pushed a button which causes the missile to transform into a robotic arm and it squeezes Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob]
Mr Krabs: Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!
Plankton: No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and off I go.
Mr. Krabs: Well you ain't getting it.
Plankton: Well I constrict you to reconsider. [presses button and arm squeezes harder]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, go jump off a plank.
Plankton: Oh well, I have other ways of getting it when I need. Where is the formula, Krabs? [tickles Mr. Krabs with feather]
Mr. Krabs: Ha ha ha ha!
Plankton: Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs? [He tickles Mr. Krabs' nose with the feather causing him to sneeze and blowing Plankton to the ground] OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.
SpongeBob: I'll never talk.
Plankton: Well, we'll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.
SpongeBob: OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!
[Everyone pauses]
Plankton: Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Errrrrrrr...
Plankton: [sniffs] Say what am I smelling? You got something burning?
SpongeBob: [sniffs] Smells like blubber to me.
Plankton: Bl bl blubber?
Pearl: Daddy!
Plankton: Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!
Mr. Krabs: She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.
Plankton: Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries! [As he say this he backs up into the freezer]
Pearl: Did he just go into the freezer?
Plankton: [exits freezer and walks out the door] Don't say it!
Pearl: I prefer salad over Plankton anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales? [chuckles evilly] Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my formular, now get us out of this trap.
Pearl: Mall money.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. [gives dollar to Pearl]. Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?
Pearl: Double my mall money!
Mr. Krabs: [grunts] Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!
SpongeBob: Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty.
Pearl: Hey, this isn't money!
SpongeBob: No, it's even better! It's the money Mr. Krabs pays me with. [money is shown] Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!
Mr. Krabs: [to self] It's all catching up to me... [to Pearl] Please, Pearl?
Pearl: No way! The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm... in that case, I'll need to borrow one of your dressers.
SpongeBob &amp; Pearl: Hummina-hunh?Huh?!
[Bubble transition to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: [runs inside]
Karen: My triumphant husband returns. How'd you fail this time?
Plankton: Krabs had a whale!
Karen: You mean his big, scary, teenage daughter?
Plankton: I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?
[Plankton's family is shown being eaten by a whale]
Karen: OK When you take a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. It's ripened.
[Bubble transition to Plankton taking out the trash]
PearlKrabs: [emerges from dumpster] I'm hungry!
Plankton: [Screams. He runs back inside and bars the door] That should keep her out!
PearlKrabs: [sneaks up behind him] I want Plankton meat!
Plankton: Holy, protozoa! [runs out the lab] Karen, she's here! She got in!
Karen: What are you talking about?
Plankton: There's a whale in the laboratory!
Karen: Are you out of your mind?
Plankton: See for yourself!
Karen: [checks the lab] No whale in here.
Plankton: I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!
Karen: Oh, that's enough, Plankton! If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more permanent primary functions. [rolls away]
Plankton: Karen! Karen--!
Karen: I'm not listening! [hums]
Narrator: 16 paranoia filled days later...
Karen: [off microphone] Plankton, your dinner is ready. Plankton? Plankton, do you hear me?
Plankton: Yes, I can hear you. Can you bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me. [cries]
PearlKrabs: [laughs. Bubble transition to night]
Plankton: [Plankton is shown having a nightmare. He is seen being chased by Pearl and falls into her blowhole] Hey! Get me out of here! [Pearl flings him into her throat with her tongue. He falls into her stomach, where his ancestors find him]
Grand-Dad: Hey Plankton! Glad you could join the rest of the family!
Plankton: Grand-Dad?
Grand-Dad: Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid.
Plankton: Gastric acid? [his body is half-burned] No! [wakes up from nightmare and screams] I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy! [cries]
PearlKrabs: [takes off disguise and laughs. Bubble transition to morning]
Plankton: [crying] What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale! [lies down] That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be along any time now.
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?
Plankton: Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.
Plankton: Forget it kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.
SpongeBob: Okay!
[Cut to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [erases a picture of Plankton] Goodbye, Pipsqueak!
SpongeBob: Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.
Mr. Krabs: Really? He's a mess! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?
Mr. Krabs: May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?
SpongeBob: No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this.
[scene cuts to Plankton]
Plankton: [angrily] Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton.
Plankton: What, do you have mud in your ears? Take a hike!
SpongeBob: Yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: What difference does it make? There's no point ever since I've been tortured by that blasted whale.
SpongeBob: Don't worry. Everyone has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is... [whispers in Plankton's ear]
Plankton: Really?
SpongeBob: Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? It was Mr. Krabs in whale suit that you've been scared of.
Plankton: You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!? [angrily] Why that conniving bottom feeder!
SpongeBob: But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you?
Plankton: No, of course not.
SpongeBob: Well, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!
Plankton: No, no. Thank you! [laughs evilly. Bubble transition]
Mr. Krabs: This is almost too fun! [puts on costume] Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!
Plankton: Oh, is that so.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes. [breaths deeply] Boo!
Plankton: You don't scare me, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean... [Pearl's voice] I'm Pearl, not Krabs.
Plankton: The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!
Mr. Krabs: Secret fear? [regular voice] What are you talkin' about?
Plankton: See for yourself. [the robotic arm squeezes Mr. Krabs] Enjoy the show! [a mime is shown]
Mr. Krabs: No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!
Plankton: Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants? I feel wonderful!
SpongeBob: Um, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.
Plankton: Why not?
SpongeBob: Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding. [Plankton gasps. Whales are outside]
Plankton: [scared] Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here! [removes a nail from the floor and jumps inside. SpongeBob puts a cork in the hole, turns off a projector, making the whales disappear, and gets Mr. Krabs out of the robot arm]
Mr. Krabs: Whew! You really redeemed yourself boy! [to mime] Okay, you're beginning to creep me out.
Narrator: Ah, the eternal expanse of the deep sea. Teeming with fantastic creatures. Uh, teeming… I’m sure they’re around here somewhere! Aha! [Zooms in on a rock with bugs on it] Oh, that’s a rock! Where is everybody? [screams] [SpongeBob is right there, and he scared the narrator] Oh, it is just SpongeBob. Watch and witness one of the rarest and mysterious rituals of the deep, the staring contest. [SpongeBob and Patrick are having a staring contest]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob’s eyes get watery and he finally blinks] Patrick, wow!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: You are the best starer I’ve ever stared at!
Patrick: Oh, staring contest! I thought it was a blinking contest and I was losing.
SpongeBob: [There is a sound like something is falling] Hark, Patrick. Do you hear something? [A message in a bottle falls on SpongeBob’s head, and SpongeBob falls down] Oh! [SpongeBob reads the note tied to the bottle] Hmm, it’s a letter for Sandy, all the way from Texas. We better deliver it!
[Scene cuts to Sandy’s treedome]
SpongeBob: Sandy! [SpongeBob tries to open Sandy’s door, but it doesn’t open] Oh, it’s not opening!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! I have something that might help. [Patrick pulls out a book called ‘How to Open Things’]
SpongeBob: How to open things. Brilliant, Patrick! I saw the movie, but I never read the book.
Patrick: Uh, ok. [Patrick flips through the pages] Garbage cans. No. Jar. No. Box. No. Sandy’s door! Twist to the left.
SpongeBob: Oh! I was twisting to the right.
Patrick: A common mistake, my good friend. [Patrick puts away the book] Allow me. [Patrick does some warm up exercises] Ok, time to open this.
Sandy: [Sandy kicks her door open] Hi-yah! Trying to ninja sneak attack? Hi-yah! Hi-yah! [Sandy kicks Patrick up in the air, and she hits SpongeBob, causing the note in the bottle on SpongeBob’s head to fall out] Well, you’re still no match for my squirrel-fu! [Sandy grabs the note and reads it] It’s a letter from my twin brother, Randy!
SpongeBob: [Patrick falls on SpongeBob] Oh!
Sandy: [SpongeBob and Patrick get into Sandy’s suit] Do you mind?
SpongeBob: Not at all. Read on.
Patrick: Doesn’t bother me.
Sandy: Get out of my suit! [SpongeBob and Patrick are flushed out of Sandy’s suit] Well, golly! Randy says the rodeo’s come to town. I’ve got to head back to Texas and defend my championship title!
SpongeBob: Championship title? For what?
Sandy: You got cotton in your ears?
Patrick: [Patrick looks in SpongeBob’s ear] Hmm, no. It’s not cotton. It’s actually an old moldy piece of Krabby Patty. [Patrick eats the Krabby patty] Mmm.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is holding a jellyfish net] Is your championship title for jellyfishing?
Sandy: No.
SpongeBob: Karate? [SpongeBob hits Patrick in the face]
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Patrick are now wearing white coats and glasses, and Patrick is holding a mini volcano] Perhaps the science fair, then.
Sandy: No. It’s my rodeo championship on the line.
SpongeBob: Rodeo? What does rodeo mean?
Sandy: ♪Critters that you gotta wrangle.♪ [Sandy pulls out a lasso and lassos SpongeBob and Patrick] ♪Cowboy suits with perty spangles.♪ [Sandy is now wearing spangles on her suit and she is wearing cowboy boots and a cowboy hat] ♪Boots with spurs that jingle jangle, that's a rodeo. Tight blue jeans you gotta squeeze in, but they sure look mighty pleasin'!♪ [Sandy gives Patrick a wedgie by putting some jeans on him.] ♪Big belt buckles are always in season!♪ [SpongeBob is wearing a big belt buckle] ♪That's a rodeo.♪

Sandy: ♪And don’t forget who makes us laugh when we’re feelin’ down. The happy slappy, sunny, funny good ol’ rodeo clown.♪ [Sandy puts on a clown suit]
SpongeBob: Clowns? [SpongeBob grabs onto Sandy] Don’t go, Sandy! It’s too risky!
Sandy: [pushes SpongeBob away] I must! It’s my duty! [Sandy’s suit turns into a rocket and Sandy rockets out of the water]
SpongeBob: Oh, this is terrible! We can’t let Sandy go all alone! It’s too dangerous up there, right Patrick?
Patrick: Eh, I’m indifferent.
SpongeBob: How could we live with ourselves if Sandy got hurt, and we weren’t there to help? Why, I wouldn’t be able to look at myself.
Patrick: Look at yourself? How do you do that? [Patrick spins around, trying to look at himself]
SpongeBob: Patrick! This is no time for silly games! Sandy needs us. You understand? Patrick? Patrick!
Patrick: [runs away, thinking about the wedgie.] No more tight jeans!
SpongeBob: Oh, I’m sure someone else will help me.
[Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs’ office in The Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: So there you have it, Mr. Krabs. Sandy really needs our help.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, explain it to me again, but this time, take out anything that doesn’t have to do with money. Uh-huh, that’s what I thought. [Mr. Krabs walks away]
SpongeBob: [sigh] I need to find someone with compassion. Someone who selflessly helps others, with no concern for his own safety. I need…A hero.
[Scene cuts to Squidward’s front yard, where Squidward it sunbathing]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! Sandy is in terrible trouble. You’ve got to help me save her!
Squidward: Oh, no! Sally’s in trouble!
SpongeBob: Uh, Sandy.
Squidward: Don’t worry, SpongeBob. Just wait right here. [Squidward walks towards his house] I’ll get my emergency squirrel rescue kit!
SpongeBob: Right-o, Mr. Tentacles, sir!
Squidward: Just don’t panic! [Squidward goes in his house and slams the door, then he climbs out the back window and walks away]
SpongeBob: Ooh uh. Well, there’s one last person I can ask.
[Scene cuts to The Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob bangs on the door] Plankton!
Plankton: [Plankton opens the door and comes out] What?
SpongeBob: Sandy’s in trouble. I need help rescuing her.
Plankton: [Plankton gets some dynamite with a timer on it] I’m kind of busy right now.
SpongeBob: Jeepers, it’ll only take a minute.
Plankton: Yeah, uh, I’d love to help, but I really got to go. [Plankton picks up the dynamite and carries it towards The Krusty Krab, and the dynamite blows up before Plankton gets to The Krusty Krab] Ouch.
SpongeBob: Ugh. Well, I’m going to go save Sandy, whether anyone wants to help or not.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob’s room]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob packs his suitcase] I guess it’s just you and me, Gary. [SpongeBob tries to pack Gary, but Gary doesn’t let go of the floor] Let’s go. Gary the snail! Do you plan on staying here while Sandy is possibly in trouble somewhere up there?
Gary: Meow meow meow?
SpongeBob: She’s the squirrel.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: No, brown. Gary, what does that have to do [Gary leaves] You too, huh? Well, we’ll see about that! [SpongeBob pulls out some bubble soap. Scene changes to nighttime]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob opens his bubble soap and blows a bubble to capture Gary. Scene cuts to Squidward’s front yard]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob blows a bubble that goes in Squidward’s window, and captures Squidward, then SpongeBob blows a bubble that goes in Patrick’s house and capture’s Patrick]
Patrick: Eh, pudding.
[Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs house, where a bubble is blown to capture Mr. Krabs. Scene cuts to Bikini Bottom, where a lot of Bikini Bottomites are captured by bubbles. Scene cuts to SpongeBob’s house, where everyone that was captured by bubbles is] 
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob blows a bubble capturing his alarm clock which goes off, popping all the bubbles]
Everyone inside a bubble: [screaming]
SpongeBob: Good morning!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What’s the meaning of this?
SpongeBob: Sandy’s in trouble, and I need all of your help to save her from the horrors of the rodeo! There are clowns there!
Squidward: SpongeBob, the next time you ‘invite’ me to one of your slumber parties, I’m calling the cops! [Squidward walks outside, and he falls because SpongeBob’s house is also in a bubble] [screams] Arrgh, Arrgh, oh, oh. What the? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob falls beside Squidward] Oh. Yes, Squidward?
Everyone who was trapped in a bubble, except Squidward: [They all walk outside, and they fall as well and scream] [The bubble comes out of the water and goes to Texas]
Mr. Krabs: Where the devil are we?
SpongeBob: It's... Texas.
Everyone in the Bubble: [screaming]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What’s that, boy? You see Sandy?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: And she’s…riding a bullfrog?
Sandy: [Sandy is riding a bullfrog] Yee-haw!
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Sandy!
Sandy: Huh?
Frog: Ribbit! [The frog bucks Sandy off]
Sandy: Ow. Gall darn it! You sea slickers made me lose the rodeo. Why are you here, anyways?
SpongeBob: To help save you from this rodeo thing!
Sandy: I don’t need to be saved! [gasps] Watch out! That old bullfrog’s got a flea on his flanks, and he’s comin’ right at ya!
Bullfrog: Ribbit, ribbit!
Everyone in the bubble:  [Screaming as they were attacked by the bullfrog, when the bubble pops everyone looks like real sea creatures when they land]
Bullfrog: Ribbit.
Patrick: Did we save Sandy?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. We didn’t.
Mr. Krabs: Did we make any money?
Gary: Meow.
Sandy: Aw, cactus! That ol’ bullfrog’s got SpongeBob! Hang on, old buddy! [Sandy lassos SpongeBob away from the bullfrog, the crowd cheers] Next time, leave the rodeos to me.
SpongeBob: Aw, nuts. [Iris out.]
SpongeBob: [sings to himself, then addresses Gary] I'm sorry, Gary. I thought you were done.... [SpongeBob is pushed down] Wow. This town is sure going downhill. [bumps into Mr Krabs' parked boat] Uh, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here?
Mr. Krabs: Well...you know...unwinding. Enjoying the free parking. [The "P" falls off the sign that reads "free parking."] [Gary's eyes start wiggling] What's happening to your little critter here?
SpongeBob: I don't know, but when he does that he usually finds change.
Mr. Krabs: Change? As in legal tender?
SpongeBob: Yeah. Watch. [A penny flies onto Gary's shell]
Mr. Krabs: Wow. Shiver me shell wax. You're like a little money detecting... Uh... You know... A sneagle.
SpongeBob: You mean snail.
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, SpongeBob. How about you bring your sneagle into work with ye?
SpongeBob: You said pets were not nothing but disease-carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace.
Mr. Krabs: But that was before I knew that they had such an amazing talent.
SpongeBob: But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him.
Mr. Krabs: I could.
[Scene skips to the Krusty Krab. Money flies from the floor onto Gary's shell and Mr. Krabs takes it.]
Mr. Krabs: There you go. Bring in that change.[money comes from the order boat and then from a piece of gum] I've been working on that one for months. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!
SpongeBob: What's so funny, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...SpongeBob. Shouldn't you be out back scrubbing the dumpster?
SpongeBob: Done and done!
Mr. Krabs: Then get back there and scrub the poop deck so to speak.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
Gary: [gets the coins on his shell]
Nat: Hey! What are you doing with my change?!
Mr. Krabs: Anything on the floor gains. [Gary gets change from two people.]
Sun Breathe Nazz: Hey! [Money goes into Mr. Krabs' pockets. The back of Mr Krabs' pants falls off and a lot of money comes out]
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Looks like I need pockets for me pockets! [A whole group of customers walks out of the Krusty Krab, muttering angrily.] Ah. Fine! With my new money finder... Who needs ya?! [slams the door] Ahh. I was about to close up shop anyways.
SpongeBob: Close up! Come on, Gare. You're coming with me.
Mr. Krabs: You aren't taking him anywhere yet. You haven't greased the fryer yet. [slams a brush in SpongeBob's mouth] Don't worry about Jerry. I'll make sure he gets his nightly craw.
SpongeBob: Gary.
[scene skips to Goo Lagoon]
Mr. Krabs: [Uses Gary like a detector. Money comes from the ground and then a sunbather.]Heh, heh. Excuse me, maam. [scene skips to the middle of Bikini Bottom; Krabs holds Gary over a sewer drain. Money comes from the sewer.] Dirty money spends just like the clean. [bumps into SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I've finished greasing the fryer. [barfs up money]
Mr. Krabs: You sure make easy work.
SpongeBob: Try telling that to my frizzled hands. [hands disintegrate]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, but you still have work to do.
SpongeBob: I do?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. How about you rearrange the wall rivets from smallest to largest?
SpongeBob: But aren't they the same size.
Mr. Krabs: That's what they want you to know. Now take a long look.
SpongeBob: Will do, captain.
Mr. Krabs: Now back to our treasure hunt. Eh, boy.
Gary: Meow. [eyes wiggle]
Mr. Krabs: You okay, boy? [money comes out of parking meters]
Gary: Meow. [hides in his shell]
Mr. Krabs: That a boy.
[scene skips to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [uses a magnifying glass] Mr. Krabs is right. Some of these rivets are off by as much as five nanometers. Well, I better get to work.
[scene skips to Mr. Krabs and Gary]
Gary: [falls asleep]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There's no stopping. There's a laundromat that needs to be cleaned out. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Cleaned out. Get it. Ahh. Never mind. MUSH!
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: If you don't get moving, I'm gonna'...
SpongeBob: You're gonna' do what, sir?
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna' give him a snaily treat. [stuffs a treat in Gary's mouth]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Ohh, okay. The rivets are all rearranged.
Mr. Krabs: What!? How is that possible? Uh, now I want you to paint the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Okay. That's easy.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, uh, uh, but I want you to do it with this toothbrush. [gives SpongeBob a toothbrush]
SpongeBob: Okay. Bye, old pal.
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry about Terry. He's in good claws.
SpongeBob: I'm sure he is. Bye.
Mr. Krabs: Now little sneagle. Ready to do some laundry? Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr.
[scene skips to the laundromat]
Mr. Krabs: Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.
Tough guy: Hey, where's my change? [Mr. Krabs runs out with Gary and the coins]
Mr. Krabs: Hee, hee, hee, hee.
Tough guy: Well, that stinks.
[scene to Mr. Krabs and Gary]
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr. I guess he didn't see that coming. [bumps into a building] Hey, what's the big ide-er? We've just found a pot at the end of the rainbow. Aieeeee! [goes in]
Old Man Jenkins: [coins fly from the machine] What the?
Mr. Krabs: It's like taking candy from a baby!
Old Man Jenkins: And that old whip shoo the coins just flew from the machine!
Security guard: Ahh, don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Mr. Krabs: Uh oh. Pronto. Time for plan B! [Mr. Krabs grabs a dress]
[scene skips to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Ah ha! That should do it! [SpongeBob climbs down a ladder] Ahh. Time to check in with Mr. Krabs to see if he needs me to do anymore impossible stuff.
Tough guy: Oh boy, I'm not gonna hear the end of this when I get home.
SpongeBob: Pardon me sir. You haven't seen a crab walking around with a snail, have you?
Tough guy: Say, are you in with those thieving criminals too?
SpongeBob: Thi-thieving what?
Tough guy: Them two jerks what stole my money. The fat one used his sneagle to swipe my coins from me.
SpongeBob: His sneagle?
Tough Guy: That's right. Why, the coins were sticking right to his shell.
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr, arr.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs. What have you done to my Gary? So this is what a hotbed of sin looks like...
[scene skips to the bathroom]
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr, arr. How's it going boyo? You feeling the coin vibes?
Gary: Pu, pu, pow.
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean you don't feel so good?
Gary: Meoow. [sweats]
Mr. Krabs: You look fine to me. Now stop being such a baby and make me some money. Excuse me, pregnant lady coming through! [walks into the security guard] Uh, he he. Hoo boy. It--it's sure hard being preggers!
Security guard: Uh...yeah. [Mr. Krabs walks on, then notices all the buckets full of coins sitting at the games.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps, then squeals as he looks at more buckets] Ooh! [pants] [People are carrying buckets and are putting their hands into them. Mr. Krabs gets nervous]
Mr. Krabs: [to Gary] Get ready for it now, boy me boy! [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! [Everyone looks at Mr. Krabs.] Thank you for your money! [Lifts up Gary. Nothing happens.] Come on Harry! Let's go. Come on you! [Shakes Gary]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! For shame!
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean? I'm just showing Rory off.
SpongeBob: Don't you lie to me! I know all about you using Gary to steal money!
Mr. Krabs: I got nothing of the soul. [Gary's eyes wiggle] I would never steal. You have to quit making up stories, boy-yo.
SpongeBob: I'm not making up anything! I know all about your little scheme! You're the one making up stories!
Mr. Krabs: Don't you have work you should be doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's rich!
Mr. Krabs: No, if I was rich I wouldn't have to hire the likes of you!
SpongeBob: That's hurtful, Mr. Krabs, and you know it!
Mr. Krabs: Why you little yellow... Well, I never...
SpongeBob: You never what? Learned to use decent language? [People scream and run.]
Mr. Krabs: Who do you think you are?! [throws Gary] Jackpot! Money, money, money, money. Come to papa. [stops] Oh boy.
[Scene skips to the hospital]
Purple doctorfish: Yeah he's in pretty bad shape with the impact of all that metal but he'll pull through.
SpongeBob: Doctor? How does this sort of thing happen?
Purple Doctorfish: I think this has something to do with it. [gives SpongeBob a magnet]
SpongeBob: Hey, my Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fridge magnet!
Purple Doctorfish: It seems to be your pet swallowed it. It has a very strong magnetic pull. [holds a coin and it flies onto the magnet]
SpongeBob: Cause' it's a magnet! That's it, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr, arr. Well, what do ya' know?
Purple Doctorfish: Unfortunately, there's still the matter of the bill. [gives Mr. Krabs the bill]
Mr. Krabs: What? Oh, I can't afford this.
Purple Doctorfish: Actually, you've got just enough change to cover it. [Mr. Krabs watches a nurse walk away with all the money]
Mr. Krabs: Nooooooo!
SpongeBob: [At SpongeBob's House, SpongeBob is chopping a smaller pineapple in half] HIYA! HIYA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! Ta-daa! A gift, in your likeness. [hands Gary the pineapple which looks like him]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: ‘Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! ‘Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?! [laughs, Gary leaves, SpongeBob continues laughing until a fly from the gift flies into his mouth, SpongeBob chokes]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. You still got that bucket of cheese? [SpongeBob tries heimliching himself, Patrick realizes SpongeBob's choking] Oh no! He's... not right! Don't worry, pal! I'll help you! [Patrick punches SpongeBob and the fly comes out]
Patrick: Buddy! You okay?
SpongeBob: Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises. [gets a watermelon] Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again, buddy. HIYA! [chops the watermelon]
Patrick: [gets the cheese bucket and eats some] [SpongeBob continues chopping items] Hey! I want to learn how to do that. [points to chopped up bread]
SpongeBob:  What, what, you mean karate?
Patrick: Uh-huh!
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to...
Patrick: If I recall correctly, I seem to remember saving your life a few minutes ago.
SpongeBob: Yeah... However...
Patrick: I also remember you saying, "If there's anything you can do to return the favor, anything at all... to let you know.
SpongeBob: Well, I did say that, Patrick, but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface. [Patrick runs over]
Patrick: Then teach me.
SpongeBob: As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility.
Patrick: Oh yeah! Mama! [cuts to training]
SpongeBob: Okay. Let’s start off simple. This is a basic move called "the inverted whirlpool".
Patrick: Inverty whirpey... Got it! [SpongeBob lays on head and twists feet, he starts moving and blasts through the objects]
Patrick: Woohoo! That was awesome!
SpongeBob: Think you can handle that?
Patrick: Yeah! Yeah! [does the same thing as SpongeBob] Ha Ha Ha Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! [continues laughing] Hey, how do you stop this thing? [heads towards lemonade stand]
Harold: Neptune's trousers! What's that?! [screams and runs away. Patrick destroys lemonade stand; cuts to next stage of training]
SpongeBob: Now, this is very easy, watch closely. [Does a move] Haa-haah. You got it?
Patrick: Definitely! [Patrick does the same but spins out of control, SpongeBob stops him and he falls]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable. [walks away]
Patrick: What?! I...! [gets mad and chops through cinder blocks] Barnacles!
SpongeBob: [looks in amazement] Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No ones ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through a wall of cinder!
Patrick: Wow!
SpongeBob: You're a natural! A karate genius!
Patrick: Clamo!
SpongeBob: [holds a sword] Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- [Patrick cuts it in half]. Wow. Amazing! [cuts to an old abandoned ship]
SpongeBob: This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes? [Patrick misses]
SpongeBob: Ahhh... better luck next time. [the boat breaks]
Patrick: Yeah! I bet I can chop anything! [goes over to Sadie and Baby Rechid]
Sadie: AAAAAHHHH!
Patrick: HIIIII-
SpongeBob: [stops Patrick] Noooooo! What did I tell you?!
Patrick: I'm a genius?
SpongeBob: Not that! [pulls out a tape recorder] ...this. [SpongeBob's voice on recorder]: With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?
Patrick: Yesss...
SpongeBob: Good! [his watch beeps] Oh man, I'm late for work. [runs] See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said.
Patrick: Okay! I'm a genius! [cuts to Patrick's rock]
Patrick: [chops hot dogs] Karate power! [eats part of the hot dog, cuts to Patrick at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [looking at magazine] What's this? Hhmmm... haven't seen this before.
SpongeBob: Hey, look, it's Patrick!
Patrick: Hi-yah, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What are you doing... [Patrick chops the door]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Dear Neptune!
Patrick: Good day, gents! Ahhh, Squidward, I would like a HIYAAA!
Squidward: A... What?
Patrick: I said one Krusty Combo. Don't you speak karate?
Squidward: [sighs]
Patrick: [chops the meal in half] Looks delish.
SpongeBob: Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice a bit too far?
Patrick: I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who called me a karate genius. And, frankly, I'm offended by your previous accusation. I don't need this! I beg you good due.
SpongeBob: But, but, but-
Patrick: No buts! Just hands. [chops door again]
SpongeBob: Oooohhh!
Mr. Krabs: You do realize I'm taking that out of your pay check.
[cuts to Patrick at the ice cream shop]
Patrick: Uuuuuhhhhh... Seaweed Surprise! Also!... uuuuuuhhhhh... Malted Coral Crunch! [ice cream is really tall] Oooh... Ooh, also, Lipids and Creme!
Lou: We're all out. In fact, we're out of everything, which means you owe us $86.50
Patrick: What do you say to a trade? [pulls out a disgusting lollipop]
Lou: I say, pay up before I call the cops.
Patrick: You dare refuse my barter?!?! Then accept my chop! [chops tip jar and ice cream flies into Patrick's mouth, he eats it and becomes fat. He becomes frozen and chops out of the ice] Ahhh... I don't feel so good.
Billy: Aha! Hand in the tip jar again, eh! [Patrick is stuck in door and chops it open]
Patrick: [sniffs] What is that wonderful stench? [walks to Harold Fish] Whatcha got there?
Harold: Spinach and chocolate spaghetti in calamari sauce. You wanna bite?
Patrick: [chops the food] NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha! [cuts to Bikini Bottom Arcade, Patrick chops a game]
Patrick: I win, I win, I win! [cuts to Krusty Krab]
Patrick: HIYAA HIYAA-
Lifeguard fish: Help! Help! There's a mad chopper on the loose!
SpongeBob: Mad chopper?! Patrick!
Lifeguard fish: We need the cops, kid!
SpongeBob: Cops? No, that won't be necessary. I'll handle this, citizen.
Lifeguard fish: Don't do it kid. [grabs his ankle]
SpongeBob: Unhand my ankle, sir, my friend needs me.
Lifeguard fish: You don't know what you're doing. Don't walk out that door! NOOOOO! [SpongeBob on his unicycle, Patrick chops a car]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: SpongeBob, just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you, buddy. [chops his unicycle]
SpongeBob: For what?
Patrick: For teaching me how to karate chop, silly.
SpongeBob: You gotta stop, buddy, you're destroying the entire town!
Patrick: [looks at the destruction] Wooooooooooo.
SpongeBob: Just stop chopping, okay, Patrick?
Patrick: You got it, buddy. No more karate chops! [chops a jail truck]
SpongeBob: You're still chopping!
Patrick: I know! Weird, huh?
SpongeBob: Patrick, stop it!
Patrick: Oh. Okay. I know, I'll stop a chop, with a chop! [Patrick chops his hand and it hits his face]"
SpongeBob: [grabs Patrick’s arm] You must resist! [flings SpongeBob on a fire hydrant] AHHHHHAAHH! [Patrick's hand pulls him away and his hand chops Squidward's hedge sculpture]
SpongeBob: Wait up, Patrick! [gasps] Triton's tunic!
Fish [off-screen]: He's headed straight for the Barg'N-Mart!
[Everyone screams and runs away]
Patrick: [in the store] HIYA YA! Oh, no! Not the muffin display... YAAAAH! [chops it]
News Reporter: This just in, a mad man is chopping everything.
Patrick: Not the giant-screen TVs! [chops it] Oh no!
News Reporter: The suspect is considered fat, pink, and dangerous.
Patrick: Oh, oh! Gianter TVs! HIYAAA! [chops one and falls]
SpongeBob: Pull it together, buddy!
Patrick: I'm trying to, but this thing has a mind of its owwwnnnn... [punches SpongeBob, SpongeBob hits a rack] YAAAAAA! [then the counter, until the whole store collapses. He emerges from the rubble.]
Patrick:  SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [spots a kitchen sponge] Oh, no! I'm so sorry, my best friend, crushed by all this rubble, entombed in this cheap, plastic bag. [cries and hugs it]
Dennis: [Emerges from the debris] That isn’t your friend, you kelp-for-brains. Those are cleaning sponges.
Patrick: [Looks at the pack closer and throws it away, becomes relieved] So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?
Dennis: Ummmm...I wouldn't say that. [Points him to rubble covering SpongeBob]
Patrick: [sees the pile of rubble] SpongeBob! Oh no! [pushes rubble off SpongeBob and gasps] Ohhh, I'll never forgive myself [cries] No! I'll never forgive you! [points to his and, pulls it off]
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Oh, hi, Patrick. What did I miss?
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're okay!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Your arm!
Patrick: Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?
SpongeBob: Hooray for regeneration!
Patrick: And in the spirit of healing, I vow to use my hands only to join things together, starting here! [rebuilds the Barg'N Mart]
SpongeBob: Hey, great job, Patrick! I like the architectural details.
Patrick #2: HIYAAA! [chops shopping cart]
SpongeBob: Patrick! I thought you gave up chopping!
Patrick: Oh, I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies.
Patrick #2: HIYYAA! [Barg'N Mart collapses again]
SpongeBob: ♪Doo Doo Doo-doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo! Doo-doo Doo Doo Doo-doo doo-doo! Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo...♪
Squidward: [growls and grabs SpongeBob's lips] Would you stop that incessant babbling!?
SpongeBob: Thowwy, Thquidward.
[Squidward growls once more]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What are you doing? It's closin' time! [Hands SpongeBob a mop and bucket] Now get out there and swab the poop deck.
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, mein captain.[He slides past Squidward, singing]♪Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo. I'm mopping and I'm singing about the Musical Doodle.♪ [Humming. Squidward walks over to SpongeBob and gets hit with the mop]
Squidward: Would you quit it with that tune already?
SpongeBob: Sorry. It's just so catchy.
Squidward: I don't care. Just can it! [Walks back to the register]
Squidward: I'll cleanse myself by listening to a little public radio. [Turns on radio. "Musical Doodle" plays]
SpongeBob: Ooh! It's "Musical Doodle," Squidward!♪Round and round the record spins all day. Listen again. It takes you far away. Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my musical doodle! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo...♪
Squidward: [Turns off radio] Figures you would be into that hideous pop fodder.
SpongeBob: It's a sign!
Squidward: A sign that you're a true boob?
SpongeBob: Yes... No! That this song and I were meant to be together.
Squidward: Great, now I hate two things.
Mr. Krabs: All right boys, time to go ho-
Squidward: [Bursts out the door] FREEDOM!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, SpongeBob. Time to hit the road. SpongeBob?
[He looks up to see SpongeBob sitting at a table listening to "Musical Doodle]
Announcer: And that's the new song by the Sonars called "Musical Doodle!"
SpongeBob: [Sighs happily] "Musical Doodle."
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh. Good night, sir. [floats out the door still singing "Musical Doodle"]
Mr. Krabs: What am I running here, a nuthouse?
[SpongeBob flies through the streets singing when a record version of "Musical Doodle" is heard and he falls down. Getting up, he sees a record shop playing "Musical Doodle." SpongeBob happily takes out a dollar. Gary is eating his dinner when SpongeBob arrives]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary! [Gary slithers away. SpongeBob grabs him] Just the pal I'm looking for. Want to hear my new record? [Gary shakes his head "No." SpongeBob chuckles] I knew you would! [He puts him down and opens his shell revealing a record player. He places the record on the turntable. "Musical Doodle" plays]
Record: ♪Round and round the record spins all day. Listen again. It takes you far away.♪ [SpongeBob joins in with the song]
SpongeBob: ♪Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle.♪ [continues singing until late into the night]♪Listen again to the Musical Doodle.♪ [He looks up to see Gary is already asleep] WHOO! Let's spin that record one more time! [Just then, he looks at the clock reading 9: 00] Wow. It's late. I have to get to sleep. [He takes the record off the turntable and puts it back in the sleeve] Come to bed when you're ready, Gary. [He walks upstairs to his bed humming. He climbs into bed and sighs happily. Suddenly, he hears himself whistling the song. He covers his mouth, but he still continues whistling it. Thinking quickly, he takes a cork and plugs up his mouth. His holes make a hollow whistling to the tune. He wakes up] Oh, fine. I'll just listen to it one more time to get it out of my system. [The scene cuts to him downstairs listening to the song]♪Round and round the record spins all day. Listen again. It takes you far away. Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle. Listen again to the Musical Doodle!♪ [Giggles] Let's listen to it one more time. [He puts the needle on the record again]♪Round and round the record spins all day.♪ One more time! ♪Round and round the record spins all day.♪
[The next morning at the Krusty Krab, a sleepy SpongeBob is standing at the grill in the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Pushin' your luck a bit, aren't you, kid? [SpongeBob looks up to see him standing in the doorway to the kitchen] You were nearly late this morning. You got to be more concientierous or I'll have to start dockin' your pay. Oh, yeah. That's what I'll do. [He whips out a tambourine and starts dancing] Doo dee doo, doo dee doo, doo doo doo! [SpongeBob cowers in fear as he shakes the tambourine at him] Musical Doodle! SpongeBob! Wake up, boy-o! Don't you need some patties to get started there?
SpongeBob: Of course. Yes, boss! [He dumps a bucket of Krabby Patties onto the grill]
Mr. Krabs: Just focus on makin' them patties, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... [Gasps, giggles nervously. Mr. Krabs walks back to his office and closes the door watching SpongeBob. As soon as he leaves, SpongeBob's legs start bobbing up and down]
SpongeBob: ♪Think you control it, but it's way too hard. Every time it plays, there's an electric charge.♪ [He covers his mouth] Hang on. Hang on. Play that last part back for me. [He presses his tooth like a rewind button which rewinds the song. He presses the play button which plays the verse that goes "Think you control it, but it's way too hard."] That's it! I shouldn't try to control it. I should stop fighting the Doodle's infectious groove. [comes into the restaurant with a Krabby Patty on a plate] ♪Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle!♪ [He lands at a table and gives the Krabby Patty to Martha Smith. He then cartwheels to the next table and gives Lonnie a Krabby Patty] ♪Think you control it, but it's way too hard. Doo doo doo-doo doo-doo doo doo doo!♪
Lonnie: Young man? [SpongeBob is still singing and dancing] Excuse me, young man! [SpongeBob keeps singing] I asked for no onions! Young man!
SpongeBob: Gonna listen again to the Musical Doodle!
Lonnie: Ugh! What is wrong with the youth of the ocean today?
[SpongeBob slides up to Frankie-Billy. As he gives him his Krabby Patty, he splashes soda in his face]
SpongeBob: Every time it plays, it's an electric charge! [He dances over to another table] The sound in your head is brutal. Now you're infected by the Musical Doodle! [Harold reaches for his patty, but SpongeBob keeps taking it away] Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo. [He places Harold's patty on top of Abigail-Marge's patty and walks off] You're gonna listen again to the Musical Doodle!
[At a table, Fred is eating his Krabby Patty. He turns around and sees SpongeBob still singing and his spit gets onto Fred.]
SpongeBob: ♪Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo!♪
Fred: [Groans in disgust] I can't eat like this. [He gets up and leaves the table]
Frankie-Billy: Me neither! [He leaves his table as well as everybody else. In his office, Mr. Krabs is sleeping on a stack of coins when he wakes up]
Mr. Krabs: That door squeak sounded decidingly disgruntled. [He opens the door and notices the customers leaving] Me customers! [He pushes the floorboard up causing the customers to fall back and on top of each other] Why are you running off? 
Martha Smith: Well I never got my fries!
Harold: I never got my patty!
Frankie-Billy: I got drenched in soda and it was all because of that yellow idiot who keeps singing that annoying song!
[Mr. Krabs looks up and growls as he looks at SpongeBob humming "Musical Doodle" while washing a table]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You gotta cut out that singin', boy! It's repellin' me profits.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I've tried and I've tried, but it keeps playing over and over in my mind.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh. Stop singin' that song! One more outburst out of me and I'll send ye home for the day!
[SpongeBob gasps. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, as he stands at the grill, he tries hard not to sing, but while straining, he closes his eyes, but they sing "The Musical Doodle!" SpongeBob keeps them shut]
SpongeBob: Keep your trap shut! But it wasn't my trap! [Suddenly, he hears his holes on his back singing. He takes a bunch of corks and plugs them up] One more outburst like that and Mr. Krabs will send you home for the day! Okay! Okay! But I feel it building up inside of me! [He covers his face, still trying not to sing. The scene then cuts to the kitchen all trashed. The walls have the word "Doodle" written all over them, the grill is tipped over, ropes of buns hang from the ceiling, ketchup and mustard bottles are stacked up, and most of the floorboards are torn up. SpongeBob stands hugging himself and humming goofily. Captions show this as "babbling musically". Mr. Krabs walks into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] What in blazes are you doing? That's it, boy! You're done for the day!
SpongeBob: Try to escape is futile! [He runs out on all fours] ♪Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo! Doo doo doo doo-doo! The Musical Doodle!♪ [He runs past Sandy who walks into the restaurant, laughs maniaclly]
Sandy: What's his deal?
Squidward: Oh, he's obsessed with this artless pop tune.
Sandy: We gotta help him but quick. He could be in great danger.
[SpongeBob runs through town]
SpongeBob: ♪The song that you ran from is back again. You wonder if the madness will ever end.♪ [runs by Patrick standing]
Patrick: Hey, buddy!
[Sandy, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs run after him]
Sandy: Come on, Pat! We need your help!
[SpongeBob, still humming, dances to his house. He crawls up the side and into the porthole window. Sandy kicks the door down as she, Mr. Krabs, Patrick, and Squidward enter]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
Patrick: SpongeBob! Where are you? [He looks up to see SpongeBob on the ceiling]
SpongeBob: Doo doo doo-doo! The Musical Doodle!
Patrick: SpongeBob! Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Sandy: Get him! [She and Mr. Krabs grab him, and pin him to the floor. Patrick pounces on them. SpongeBob is taped to a chair. Sandy looks at him through a magnifying glass]
Sandy: Just as I thought. You're suffering from a condition known as "Earworm." You see, when your brain becomes stuck on a catchy tune, you're spectable with earworm infection and you've got a nasty one there.
[In SpongeBob's head, a little green worm sits in his rocking chair listening to "Musical Doodle"]
Mr. Krabs: Let's just rip the little sucker out!
Sandy: Hold it! We can't do that. It might damage his brain. The only way to drive the earworm out is with another catchy tune.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I got one! It's an old sea shanty me and me mates used to sing on the high seas. [He puts a sailor's hat on his eye, singing] ♪It be drowsy and wet on the mighty high seas, for I need a boat for rapid disease. Oh, mateys. Oh, mateys. Don't ever weep! If I so ever sleep, cast me into the deep!♪ [He glares at the earworm in SpongeBob's head and is still listening to the Musical Doodle] He ain't budgin'.
Sandy: I'll be darned if anyone can resist a Western song while wearing a Western hat. Come here, you! [She pulls out a guitar and places a miniature cowboy hat on the earworm, singing] ♪Oh, life on the prairie is lonesome indeed. Not a friend in sight among the rustling weeds. So, when I get lonesome, I don't have a conniption, I just fire up my friend, Generator Contraption!♪ [The earworm throws the cowboy hat away] That only seems to have made him madder. We need somebody with really musical talent to get rid of this thing.
Squidward: Alright. I'll do it. But only because you required an artist of such high talent.
Sandy: Oh, right. Squidward. You play that little doohickey.
Squidward: It's called a clarinet. [He takes his clarinet and walks over to SpongeBob. He begins playing his clarinet. The earworm falls out of his chair. As Squidward keeps playing, the earworm, wearing a fedora and carrying a breifcase, slips out of SpongeBob's head and slithers away]
Sandy: You did it! Drove the little critter out!
Patrick: Hold still, buddy! [He rips the tape off SpongeBob, as well as most of his skin. SpongeBob runs to Squidward and gives him a hug]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Squidward!
Squidward: Alright. You're grateful. Now leave me alone. [He pushes SpongeBob away and hugs him again. At night, Squidward climbs into bed]
Squidward: That was a near little tune I came up with today, if I do say so myself.
[As he closes his eyes, the earworm slithers across his head, slips under his eyelid, and into his head. As Squidward begins humming, the song he played earlier begins playing in his head]
Squidward: Oh, yeah. That's catchy stuff, Squiddy. Catchy stuff. Mmm-hmm. [Screams]
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, uh...
SpongeBob: SpongeBob.
Patrick: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob and Patrick stare at each other for about 30 seconds, blinking occasionally]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: You wanna play hide-and-seek?
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Okay! I figure that that spot over there by those rocks is a good place to-
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah...?
Patrick: Do I have to know what hide-and-seek is in order to play it?
SpongeBob: [Laughing] C'mon, Patrick, quit fooling around! We've played hide-and-seek dozens of times!
Patrick: Dozens?
SpongeBob: Thousands!
Patrick: Thousands?!
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know for sure how many I...
Patrick: Gosh!
SpongeBob: Gosh what?
Patrick: I didn't know hide-and-seek had so much mathematics.
[Bubble transition changes the scene]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's simple. [stands behind a rock] A person stands behind a rock, like this. [covers his eyes] Then they cover their eyes. [uncovers one of his eyes] And count while the other person runs and hides!
Patrick: Hey, you're peeking!
SpongeBob: I thought you said you didn't know how to play.
Patrick: Play what?
SpongeBob: Hide-and-seek!
Patrick: Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I do! I do know how to play!
SpongeBob: Oh, good!
Patrick: I- I just have one tiny question.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Patrick: What's hide-and-seek? [Bubble transition changes the scene]
SpongeBob: [with socks on his hands] You think you're getting it now, Patrick? Did you find the sock puppet demonstration to be useful?
Patrick: Hide-and-seek: a game played by two or more players in which one player chosen at random counts aloud to a pre-determined number while the remaining players hide. Upon reaching said number, the counting player now embarks on a search for the other players. [SpongeBob takes his socks off his hands and puts them back on his feet] The search continues until all players are located and a winner is determined.
SpongeBob: Hey, you really are getting it!
Patrick: Hide-and-seek sure sounds fun, [gets choked up] I just wish I could play! [starts crying]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, come on. Of course we can play!
Patrick: Oh no! I can't! [sobbing in despair]
SpongeBob: Why can't you?
Patrick: Because... I don't have any socks! [bawls uncontrollably]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, forget about the socks.
Patrick: What socks?
SpongeBob: Never mind, just start counting.
Patrick: [Covering his eyes] One, two, three... [continues counting]
SpongeBob: That's perfect! Now I'm gonna run and hide.
Patrick: Seven, eight...
SpongeBob: Now I'm all over, where am I gonna hide? [Looks to the right, then the left] Hmmm. [Lifts his finger up, then puts his finger in his mouth and sticks out his tongue before licking his finger and puts the finger in and out] That's definitely one idea.
Patrick: Seventy-eight, seventy-nine, a hundred! Four! A-ha! I found you. I win, I win, I win! In your face! [Pokes SpongeBob in the face] I must be the best hide-and-seek player ever!
SpongeBob: All right, it's my turn to count. You know what you're supposed to do right?
Patrick: OF COURSE! I'm the best hide-and-seek player ever aren't I?
SpongeBob: Right. Here I go. [covers eyes] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Patrick: [thinking] Do you hear that? No, what is that? Oh, it's SpongeBob. Why is he counting? I guess I'll just go home, maybe or later he'll want to play a game, or something.
SpongeBob: Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty... [Patrick lifts up his rock and jumps in] Ninety-nine, [uncovers eyes] a hundred! Now where is he hiding? [Looks at Patrick's rock] Nah, way too obvious. [Walks away, little realizing that Patrick was taking out his trash] Come out, come out wherever you are! [Looks behind kelp and through a rock, but the rock is upside down a flower springs behind him] Patrick! [Sees something that looks like Patrick's head, sticking out of the ground] Patrick! [Lifts his head up, but it is brain coral] This is gonna be harder than I thought.
Squidward: La da dee, la da dum, la da doo... [Reaches for his keys]
SpongeBob: Squidward! [Squidward is rummaging now] SQUIDWARRRD! [Squidward is flicking] Squidward!
Squidward: No! [Flicks through carrots]
SpongeBob: Squidward! [Squidward tries to get in the house, but the key snaps, meaning he is stuck with SpongeBob. Screams]
SpongeBob: Squidward.
Squidward: WHAT?!
SpongeBob: I'm playing hide-and-seek with Patrick and I was wondering if I could search for him in your house.
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Okay. See ya, bye.
Mr. Krabs: Patty's kr [Bangs into a letter] What the... [An a falls near him] Time for the shelter! Doomsday came sooner than I thought.
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, how do they know my name?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, up here!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: I'm playing hide-and-seek with Patrick. I thought I'd look for him on this sign.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! That makes me furious!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll clean it up.
Mr. Krabs: It's not that! It's just that you haven't paid the fee.
SpongeBob: The fee?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, you know. The Krusty Krab Hide-and-Go Seekers' Fee. For playing hide-and-seek on Krusty Krab premises.
SpongeBob: Oh, that one. I almost forgot. [Throws coins into Mr. Krab's chest]
Mr. Krabs: Okay! Good luck finding him!
SpongeBob: Thanks Mr. Krabs! Darn it! [cut scene to boating school and the bell rings. SpongeBob is looking under boats]
Mrs. Puff: Where could that awful noise be coming from? It's been going on for hours now. SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: What are you doing? My class can hardly hear me teach.
SpongeBob: I'm trying to lift this boat. I think Patrick's hiding underneath it.
Mrs. Puff: Why would he be doing that?
SpongeBob: Because we're playing hide-and-seek. Wanna play?
Mrs. Puff: Me? Why, no, I couldn't
SpongeBob: Are you sure?
Mrs. Puff: Yes.
SpongeBob Are you sure you're sure?
Mrs. Puff: Yes
SpongeBob: Are you sure you're sure you're sure?
Mrs. Puff: Yes I'm sure.
SpongeBob: Are you sure you're sure you're sure you're sure?
Mrs. Puff: Yes
SpongeBob: Are you sure you're sure you're sure you're sure you're sure?...
Mrs. Puff: Actually, SpongeBob, I will play. [lifts up the boat, throws it and makes a fire]
SpongeBob: Nope, he's not under there. Thanks for checking under your car, Mrs. Puff.
Sandy: Yes [SpongeBob rushes through the door] SpongeBob? What are you doing with that magnifying glass?
SpongeBob: Looking for Patrick. I've been seeking and seeking all day, but I can't find him.
Sandy: Oh, that's terrible news.
SpongeBob: I know.
Sandy: Come on. You ain't gonna find him with that drab little thing. I've got something better. [pushes a button and a submarine comes up]
SpongeBob: Wow. Are you sure it's okay for me to use this?
Sandy: I keep this thing here for emergencies. This is an emergency. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes. Yes, absolutely. [climbs into the submarine] Thanks again, Sandy
Sandy: Be careful! [Hole breaks in treedome. SpongeBob searches everywhere. Cut scene to map of Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Darn it. "Welcome to the end of the world, café and gift shop". [Walks in]
Waiter: May I help you, son?
SpongeBob: I'm looking for my friend Patrick.
Waiter: You mean a big mouthish fellow with a pointy head?
SpongeBob: Exactly.
Waiter: I have not seen him.
SpongeBob: Oh. Oh, well, thanks anyway.
Waiter: Wait! Is he pink?
SpongeBob: Yeah
Waiter: Well, in that case, he's sitting right over there.
SpongeBob: I can't believe it! Patrick, it really is you.
Patrick Not-Star: My name is Patrick. '[turns around] Patrick Not-Star.
SpongeBob: Patrick Not-Star? Oh no! '[starts crying] You aren't the one I'm seeking! Now I'll never find Patrick! He wins at hide and seek! He wins, he wins!
Patrick Not-Star: So he wins. What's so bad about that?
SpongeBob: Well, if he wins, I lose.
Patrick Not-Star: Did you have fun playing?
SpongeBob: Yeah
Patrick Not-Star: Well, then, it's okay to lose, as long as you have fun doing it.
SpongeBob: Hey, you're right! Thanks, Patrick Not-Star.
Patrick Not-Star: Just one more thing.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Patrick Not-Star: Do you have a dollar I can borrow?
'[Cut to SpongeBob leaving a note outside Patrick's house; the rock opens to reveal Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! You were under there the whole time?
Patrick: Under where?
SpongeBob: I was just leaving this note for you.
Patrick: "Dear Patrick: I couldn't find you so you win. But that's OK because I still had fun playing. You are truly the greatest hide-and-seek player in the whole world. Love SpongeBob. Thanks SpongeBob. That really means a lot."
SpongeBob: Patrick I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it.
Patrick: I still have one question.
SpongeBob: Ask away.
Patrick: What's hide and seek?
Mr. Krabs: It's comin' up on that time again. Okay, boy, fire her up.
SpongeBob: With pleasure, Mr. Krabs. [puts on rubber gloves and gets the key from underneath his shoe. Puts the key into the stove ignition and turns it on to work like a car. Pushes on the pedal] I love this part of the job.
Mr. Krabs: Don't forget the cheese.
SpongeBob: And this part ain't bad either! [gets out a cheese slice, inserts it into his body, and squirts it out of his holes in square slices]
Mr. Krabs: Looks good, kiddo. You want to do the honors?
SpongeBob: [gasps] You don't mean...
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I mean.
SpongeBob: [gets on his knees and bows to Mr. Krabs] Thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you. It is both an honor and a privilege that I shall---
Mr. Krabs: What are you going on about? I let you turn the sign every day. [cut to SpongeBob walking up to the closed sign and puts a briefcase down. Opens it up to put on his 'ceremonial gloves' to turn the sign]
SpongeBob: As I don the ceremonial white gloves, I can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the Krusty Krab...open. [turns the sign from 'closed' to 'open'] Patrons, spring forth. [SpongeBob holds the front door open] The Krusty Krab will now seat you. [no one is there]
Mr. Krabs: [storms to SpongeBob] All right, you landlubbers, get the lead-- [gasps] Neptune's jewels! Where are all me costumers? And just when the Krabby Patty was about to go triple platinum. Squidward. Squidward? Squidward!
SpongeBob: [looks behind the counter] No need to shout Mr. Krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, "As The Tide Turns."
Squidward: Shut it, SpongeBob. Gil is about to reveal his secret.
Gill: You understand? Them guppies — them's my children.
Squidward: I knew it!
Mr. Krabs: In case you two haven't noticed, we got no customers! And we're not gonna get 'em back if you two lazy Susans sit around the TV all day.
Sea Chicken: [on TV] Cock-a-doodle-yum! [squawks] Rise and shine! We're the best restaurant in the sea!
Mr. Krabs: [jumps on Squidward, squishing him] Who dares lay claim to the title best restaurant in the sea?
Sea Chicken: [on TV] The Sea Chicken Shack!
Announcer: [on TV] Say, Mr. Sea Chicken, how's the flavor of that zesty sea chicken sandwich?
Sea Chicken: [on TV] It's im-peck-able! [squawks] So come on down to my Sea Chicken Shack, and don't forget the kids. [four kids come up to him and hang on him]
Mr. Krabs: Blimey, this is the first I've heard of this Mr. Sea Chicken. There goes me monopoly. But how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast? SpongeBob, I need you to head over to the Sea Chicken Shack and see what's cookin'.
SpongeBob: You want me to go undercover?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, that won't be necessary, boy. Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers.
SpongeBob: Understood, Mr. Krabs. [raises his arm and takes a picture with his armpit] How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh? Huh?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I don't need a spy.
SpongeBob: Oh, and check this out—a special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?
Mr. Krabs: Right.
SpongeBob: Well, you'd be mistaken, sir, because this pen is also...a pencil. Hmm? Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Boy, stop this nonsense!
SpongeBob: You're right, sir. Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts? I blend in with the common man. Then, like a whisper, I am gone. [cut to Sea Chicken Shack where SpongeBob is in disguise] Yellow Scrubber to Big Red. Come in, Big Red.
Mr. Krabs: Just tell me what you see, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax. [customer sits on a chair, but it collapses] And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon.
Charlie: [drenching in sweat after running a marathon] Oh, so it's a crime now to exercise.
Mr. Krabs: What about the food?
SpongeBob: I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I obtained sample.
Cashier: Next.
SpongeBob: One of your finest sandwiches, please.
Cashier: I'm afraid I can't do that, sir. Please refer to our policy regarding dress.
SpongeBob: [reads policy] "Headbands equal no service." Barnacles! My disguise's only weakness. [two employees grab SpongeBob and take him away] Whoa! Mayday, Big Red. Contact has not been established. Mission abort. Mission abort! [employees throw SpongeBob out] Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel.
Mr. Krabs: Cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the Sea Chicken Shack?
SpongeBob: Other than the faux dilapidation, not really.
Mr. Krabs: What you're describin' is an absolute dump. Are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way?
SpongeBob: No. Great Barrier Reef!
Mr. Krabs: What is it, lad? What do you see?
SpongeBob: I see a huge statue depicting Mr. Sea Chicken and all his glory! [a bunch of kids are climbing on the giant statue]
Mr. Krabs: A statue? How does a statue steal me customers? [static on other end of radio] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? [he's taken his wristband radio off and is now climbing on the giant chicken statue] Of course, Mr. Sea Chicken, you mad trickster, you, cater to the kids and the parents will foll-er. [cut to later at Krusty Krab] Boys, we don't have much time, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I need an artist, someone with a vision...
Squidward: Oh, boy.
Mr. Krabs: Someone among us with a big talent...
Squidward: He's talking about me.
Mr. Krabs: Someone to create a glorious, towering statue of my likeness. You guys know anyone around here with an artistic bone in their body?
SpongeBob: [babbling] I do.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, really? Who?
SpongeBob: Guess.
Mr. Krabs: Um, Larry the Lobster?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: Old Man Jenkins?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: One-tooth Sally?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: My mom?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: Then who?
Squidward: For the love of all things briny, it's me!
SpongeBob: Correct.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's right, Squidward. You do dabble in the doodlin' doodly-doo.
Squidward: For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius.
SpongeBob: Word.
Squidward: Unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces. Goodbye.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, now hold on, Mr. Squidward. You and I aren't that different from each other. We both "make product."
Squidward: Are you suggesting the Krabby Patties are art?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?
Squidward: Oh, I don't know, 12?
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday.
Squidward: [sighs] All right, Krabs, I'll do it. But I will need complete artistic control.
Mr. Krabs: You got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow.
Squidward: Yes, tom—tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs: As advertised.
Squidward: I can't make a work for the ages overnight. Art does not march to a ticking clock. Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir.
Mr. Krabs: If you want the public to experience your cultural input, get it ready by 8:00am.
Squidward: I'll need an assistant.
Mr. Krabs: Here you go. [SpongeBob is Squidward's assistant]
Squidward: Fine. The first thing I need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that I may sculpt this masterpiece.
SpongeBob: Anything for the artiste.
Squidward: And don't dilly... [SpongeBob pushes a giant stone into the Krusty Krab] ...dally. Nice rock.
SpongeBob: Isn't it? I can't believe no one was using it. [SpongeBob took the rock from a museum, which collapses from not having the rock]
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna be rich!
Squidward: I'm gonna be famous!
SpongeBob: I'm gonna be Squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher! [cut to later where Mr. Krabs is posing for Squidward]
Squidward: Prepare to be immortalized in stone.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? I'm...shy.
Squidward: I am posing you! Did you think the sculpture was going to make itself? [shot of Mr. Krabs from behind] Don't you want the money this statue's going to bring in? [Mr. Krabs drops the towel]
Mr. Krabs: Like this?
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Or this? [poses with a bow and arrow]
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Or this? [poses with a golden discus]
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Or this? [poses as The Thinker]
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, come on, Squidward. [sniffs his armpits]
Squidward: Mm. [gets an idea] Hold that pose! Don't move a muscle. [chuckles]
Mr. Krabs: How long am I gonna have to stay like this?
Squidward: As long as it takes. [Squidward uses various tools for sculpting. SpongeBob poses for a bit but Squidward sends him away. Mr. Krabs grows tired of the post, but SpongeBob helps him out by putting a spoon and fork under his arms to help them stay up. Cut to next morning where Squidward gets finished with the sculpture and sighs]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, Squidward, I'm about to give out!
Squidward: All done. [the spoon and fork break into pieces and Mr. Krab's left arm snaps]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, let's see it!
Squidward: Make sure you wear sunglasses, or you may be blinded by my genius.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, just show me. [Squidward pulls back the curtain]
Squidward: Voila!
[Mr. Krabs looks at the unveiled masterpiece standing before him, and his grin of anticipation slowly turns into a frown, then his body forms cracks, and shatters into bits. The masterpiece is revealed to look like Mr. Krabs, but with a sharp-toothed mouth on the stomach]
Mr. Krabs: [stands up] What's that supposed to be?
Squidward: This is a masterpiece.
Mr. Krabs: I don't have a mouth in my stomach!
Squidward: It represents the gaping, mashing maw of consumerism and the endless cavern it creates within us all. I call it Mopression.
Mr. Krabs: Whatever that means. But is it safe for kids to play on?
Squidward: This is art, not a swing set!
Mr. Krabs: Well, we should do a dry run before we let the general public use it. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reporting for duty, sir!
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna need you to frolic and play on this here doohickey thingy.
Squidward: It is not a doohickey, it's art!
SpongeBob: I read you loud and clear, captain. Loud and clear. [swings on the statue's nose and it falls on top of him] Wow. This is heavy.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! I can't let kids play on that—that—that weapon! I'm gonna get my pants sued off!
Squidward: What, you wanted a piece or art and that's what you got.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's a piece all right, a piece of junk!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if I may be allowed to float an idea.
Mr. Krabs: Did you hear something? [cut to Mr. Krabs being painted golden and having kids climb on him] Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?
Squidward: As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties. [Mr. Krabs groans]
SpongeBob: I think you look really good, sir. You're golden! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [has Krabby Patty meat in a container] Ooh... delicious!
[He blows out more Krabby Patties onto a nearby table and puts them all into the freezer, then rolls up the leftover meat into a top hat then puts it on.]
SpongeBob: (British accent) Top of the morning to ya! [laughs, then makes the meat into a version of Gary and it meows. Then makes the meat into a telephone and answers it] Krusty Krab, SpongeBob speaking! [laughs again but the telephone suddenly starts to ring and answers it] Gary? Is that you? [pause] Gary, I know you're there. I can hear you breathing! [hangs the phone up then makes the meat into a hot dog-like shape and gasps] Ooh! [boils the meat in water on the stove]
Narrator: One wiener later...
SpongeBob: [enters Mr. Krabs' office holding the hot dog] Mr. Krabs! This wiener tastes just like a Krabby Patty! Maybe we could add them to the menu?
Mr. Krabs: I'm not impressed...
SpongeBob: I made it with leftover ingredients.
Mr. Krabs: Now I'm impressed!
Frank: [enters the Krusty Krab and walks to the empty cash register] Hmm... I could've sworn that sign said "Open."
Squidward: [outside] Sigh... Once in a while, I need to breathe in and not smell grease. Or the stench of my miserably failed life... Talking to myself... again...
SpongeBob: [showing Mr. Krabs how to make a Krusty Dog] And then I just cooked it like this!
Mr. Krabs: Go on.
Frank: My! What an interesting shape! Are those for sale?
Mr. Krabs: Why? Would you like to buy one?
Frank: Well, that would depend on the price.
Mr. Krabs: Would you pay the same as what a Krabby Patty costs?
Frank: Hmm... sure, I suppose so!
Mr. Krabs: How about double?
Frank: Now you're talking!
Customer: Krabby Patties again? [sighs] If only there were something else... [notices Frank eating a Krusty Dog] Hey, whatcha got there Frank?
Frank: It's new! Tastes just like a Krabby Patty, but it's shaped like a wiener! [walks off]
All three customers: That sounds interesting!
Dave: [talking to SpongeBob] Hey! I'd like to request a wiener!
Two customers: Me too!
All three customers: Wieners! Wieners! Wieners!
[Mr. Krabs climbs up to the menu sign and writes "Krusty Dogs" on it in red chalk]
SpongeBob: Squidward, what's that noise?
Squidward: Excruciating.
Mr. Krabs: Up here, boy! Take a look!
SpongeBob: I can't read it from here, Mr. Krabs! What's it say?
Mr. Krabs: It says "Krusty Dogs, only $3.99!" Or $4.99 with cheese!
Squidward: $4.99!? That's highway robbery!
Mr. Krabs: Avec fromage, Monsieur Squidward. Avec fromage.
SpongeBob: My Krusty Dog! Handwritten on the menu! Oh, pinch me Squidward!
Squidward: Pinch yourself, you ninny.
Narrator: The following day...
Mr. Krabs: [runs to SpongeBob holding a ticket] SpongeBob! Three more Krusty Dogs! Pronto!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye Captain! [dumps three Krusty Dogs in a pan of hot water]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Three more orders of Krusty Dogs! Extra Krusty!
SpongeBob: Wow, Mr. Krabs! We sure are gettin' a lot of orders for Krusty Dogs!
Mr. Krabs: Yep!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'll get those going right after I finish cooking up these Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, forget about making those patties! Just make the wieners! [gives SpongeBob the ticket]
SpongeBob: Just make the wieners? [follows Mr. Krabs who is holding a ladder] Um, excuse me, Mr. Krabs? Uh, w-where are you going with that ladder? Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm just going to make a few changes to the Krusty Krab menu, that's all.
SpongeBob: Changes...?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that reminds me! Do you have an eraser I could borrow?
SpongeBob: Eraser?
Mr. Krabs: [on top of the ladder] Ah, never mind. I'll just cross it off. [uses the chalk to mark out "Krabby Patties"] No more Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob: [shocked] No more Krabby patties...[passes out, then two paramedics put a breathing mask on him]
Paramedic 1: Okay, just breathe normally, son.
SpongeBob: No more Krabby patty…
Paramedic 1: There you go. That's it.
Paramedic 2: There! He's startin' to revive.
SpongeBob: I had this horrible dream that Mr. Krabs was never gonna let me cook Krabby Patties again. [sees Mr. Krabs pushing his grill out from the kitchen, much to his shock]
Mr. Krabs: Pardon me.
SpongeBob: [falls on the floor crying]
Paramedic 2: We're losin' 'im!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs throws grill into trash heap]
Mr. Krabs: [zoomed in on Mr. Krabs eyes] SpongeBob. SpongeBob. Wake up. 
SpongeBob: [being held in the two paramedics arms] Where am I? And what are these paramedics doing here?
Mr. Krabs: You're back in yer old kitchen. And the pair of paramedics were here to revive ye.
SpongeBob: I was asleep?
Kr. Krabs: Yea, but just for a little while, so I only docked your pay for the time you were unconscious.
SpongeBob: [looks over at the empty space where the grill used to be] Mr. Krabs, isn't that where the grill used to be? [points to empty space]
Mr. Krabs: Maybe. But now we have this! [unveils a small hot dog cooker]
SpongeBob: And what about my... my spatula? [tears fill his eyes]
Mr. Krabs: I gotcha a new one! [lifts up hot dog holder]
SpongeBob: [catches hot dog holder, accidentally pinching his nose with it]
Mr. Krabs and the paramedics: [laugh at SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Alright! Those wieners aren't going to rotisserie themselves. Everybody back to work.
Mr. Krabs and paramedics: [walk away] [Mr. Krabs pushes the hot dog cooker up to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Aye aye, captain. [he sadly taps the small cooker with the hot dog holder]
SpongeBob: [approaches Squidward] Squidward, can I talk to you for one second?
Squidward: I don't know. That's a pretty long talk. 
SpongeBob: Has anything ever happened at your job that made it... not as fun as it used to be?
Squidward: Actually, yes.
SpongeBob: Really?! What was it? 
Squidward: Being hired. 
SpongeBob: I don't know why, but things aren't just the same after Krusty Dogs were added to the menu. 
Squidward: SpongeBob, my boy, I realized long ago that there is nothing, I repeat, nothing, that could make this job any more boring, or humiliating, or demeaning that it already is. 
Squidward: [wearing hot dog suit outside Krusty Krab] 
Billy: Look at that guy dressed like a hot dog, Mommy. 
Mom: Let that inspire you to stay in school, Billy. 
Billy: [runs back and kicks Squidward]
SpongeBob: [approaches Mr. Krabs, who is hammering a sign to a support beam] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy SpongeBob! How goes the wieners?
SpongeBob: Eh, I was kinda wondering... could we just go back to selling Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: What on earth for?! Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever, boy!
SpongeBob: I know. Well, I guess I sorta miss the Krabby Patties. After all, they're what gave this place its name.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, good point.
SpongeBob: Yeah! Don't you think that we should… [SpongeBob watches Mr. Krabs dash outside and change the sign to "The Krusty Dogs] Krusty Dog?! Those wieners have got to go!
SpongeBob: [serves Abigail-Marge and Dale their hot dogs] Here you go, hungry customers, your delicious Krusty Dogs!
Abigail-Marge: They do look delicious!
SpongeBob: Yes! [whispers into her ear] Eat one and you'll develop an unsightly skin condition.
SpongeBob: [approaches another customer] Here's your footlong, sir! 
Jimmy: Thanks! 12 inches of deliciousness!
SpongeBob: Yeah! You know what gives them that added flavor?
Jimmy: No, what?
SpongeBob: [whispers into ear]  Nose hairs and recycled dental floss.
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: We have gotta get rid of these wieners and bring back the Krabby Patty!
Squidward: SpongeBob, I never thought I'd be saying this, but... count me in!
SpongeBob: Hurray!
Squidward: [bursts into Krusty Krab] Help! I'm having terrible abdominal pain! I think it was the... the... [looks over at SpongeBob] Line?
SpongeBob: Wiener. 
Squidward: The wiener!
SpongeBob: [dressed in a brown coat and beard] Ladies and gentlemen! Allow me to introduce myself. I am but a simple, old-timey gentlemen. I came here for one purpose today.
Mable: So I said, it didn't smell so bad, but it tastes aw-
SpongeBob: Quiet, Granny, I'm talking!
Mable: Oh.
SpongeBob: And that is to loudly decry these modern, new-fangled days of wieners, and to band for a return to a simpler time. A Krabby Pattier time! [looks at customers] 
Sadie: I'm not really conceded about possible ill-health effects. How about you guys?
Clay: Eh.
Dennis: How about nostalgia? 
Sadie: Never heard of it. [continues eating]
SpongeBob: Okay, that didn't work at all.
Squidward: It only seemed to increase their appetite for wieners.
SpongeBob: We need stronger tactics. 
Squidward: Right, something that would make Mr. Krabs' whole wiener thing blow right up in his face! 
SpongeBob: Yeah, blow up. [facial expression changes to happy] Squidward, that's it! [skips and laughs away] 
SpongeBob:  [grabs balloons from a drawer, puts one in a Krusty Dog] Beautiful.
SpongeBob:  [serves to customer with a air pump connected to the Krusty Dog] Your Krusty Dog, sir, with extra mustard. 
Nat: Thanks. 
SpongeBob: Can I bring you something else? [silence] Okay, I guess not. Thank you sir. [walks away] 
Nat: [picks up Krusty Dog, slowly starts bringing it to his mouth]
SpongeBob: [watches customer] Wait for it SpongeBob. Wait for it. Now! [pushes down on air pump, filling up the balloon, and the hot dog]
Sadie: Yeah, remember that, that was... Oh, my Neptune! [sees hot dog expanding] That Krusty Dog is about to explode!
Nat: What? Where? [Krusty Dog explodes, shooting meat on all the customers]
All customers: [begin screaming and angrily leaving]
SpongeBob: Have a nice day! 
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What happened in here? Where all me customers?! What are we gonna do?
SpongeBob: Oooh! I know the answer.
Mr. Krabs: [pops in window looking at SpongeBob grilling Krabby Patties] Hey, SpongeBob! Have you seen Mr. Squidward? 
SpongeBob: I think he's outside on his break.
Mr. Krabs: Perfect! And keep them Krabby Patties coming, boy! 
SpongeBob: Aye aye, captain! 
Squidward: [standing outside Krusty Krab in a Krabby Patty suit, waving a sign saying "THEY'RE BACK!]. 
Billy: Mom, look! It's a guy dressed as a Krabby Patty! 
Mom: It's never too soon to start picking a good college, Billy. [runs back and kicks Squidward to the ground] 
Squidward: Well, I guess I was wrong again. It can always get more humiliating.
Squidward: [Starts with showing SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's houses] It's finally complete! [shows Squidward in his house at a table] After weeks and weeks of burning the candle at both ends, [voice calms down] literally, [a double-sided, burned candle is shown, and his voice returns in a louder tone] my first clarinet concerto is complete and ready to be performed! [Squidward falls at a quake, and his clarinet concerto papers fall in the fire of the double-sided candle] NO! [Squidward is quaked again] Now, I'm flummoxed. [Squidward opens his front door, and he hits his head four times as he yells "Doh, doh, doh, doh"] Drggh. [SpongeBob and Patrick are shown hammering a "For Rent" sign]
SpongeBob: Hit it one more time Patrick. Don't want anyone stealing it. [Patrick hammers the sign into the ground, and it is destroyed to pieces] Perfect [SpongeBob claps his hands.]
SpongeBob: Good Job Patrick.
Squidward: Drrrrrgh! All right, what's going on out here? I can't even hear myself think!
Patrick: [Raises his hand] Oh! Ooh! Can you smell yourself think?
Squidward: [Calmly] No. [raises his voice] As I was saying, you two... [Patrick interrupts]
Patrick: Or see?
Squidward: No!
Patrick: [screams] How, how about taste? Can you taste yourself think?
Squidward: Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?
SpongeBob: We were just posting Patrick's new "For Rent" sign. Did we work on it all morning, see? [the sign is shown]
Squidward: For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.
Patrick: Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean?
Squidward: Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?
Patrick: First come, first, serve.
Squidward: Oh great, now another idiot can move in.
SpongeBob: Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.
Squidward: Oh I would love to. Just let me check my planner. [takes out his planner and looks in it]
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks!
Squidward: Oh no, I'm sorry I can't.
SpongeBob: Aww, why not?
Squidward: It's because I was planning to do "No such thing"! See?
SpongeBob: Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks. [Bubble transition]
Squidward: With those two bone bags gone, I now have enough time for some peace and... [everything shakes] ...quiet. [walks outside] Now what are those two boobs up to? I thought you guys were... [SpongeBob and Patrick aren't there] Hmmm. I wonder who was making all that noise.
Howard: Hello. My name is Howard.
Squidward: Hello, Howard.
Howard: I noticed this "For Rent" sign. Is this yard still for rent?
Squidward: Sorry, you're too late.
Howard: Hmmm. Howard is disappointed.
Squidward: Aren't we all?
Howard: I thought this would be the one place to pursue my passions...
Squidward: [peeks out door] Passions?
Howard: ...play the bassoon...
Squidward: The bassoon?
Howard: ...and enjoy a nice cup of tea in my front yard.
Squidward: [speaks gibberish] I can't believe what I am hearing. [sighs] Finally, a neighbor that has it! I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, and performing a duet at the Bikini Bottom concert! [sighs again]
Howard: [leaving] Farewell. I new this was too good to be true.
Squidward: [stops him] Wait! Don't go!' '[panting] I was...just kidding!
Howard: Well, in that case, I should move in right away! [invites Squidward] Make yourself at home.
Squidward: Wow, his designs are impeccable! [to Howard] Yes, I do feel "at home".
Howard: I would like to propose a toast—to a new neighbor.
Squidward: To a new neighbor! [they both drink tea]
Howard: While we're on the topic, what are the other neighbors like?
Squidward: [nervous] Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors.
Howard: That's neat. I'm the neighbor that likes all kinds of neighbors!
Squidward: Well, that's nice!
Howard: Well, as long they aren't jellyfishers. [Squidward nearly chokes on his tea] I can't STAND anyone who jellyfishes. But, luckily, they're not the worst kind of neighbor.
Squidward: Well, that's nice.
Howard: That would be the bubble blowers. [Squid spits out his tea] Between the jellyfishers and the bubble blowers, I just couldn't stand to stay in my old neighborhood anymore.
Squidward: Well, you won't even NOTICE what the neighbors around here are like! [Squid looks out the window. SpongeBob and Patrick return from jellyfishing and notice the trailer]
Patrick: SpongeBob, look! There's a mobile home parked in front of my house!
SpongeBob: Do you know what that means?
Frankie Billy: Excuse me, a patty for the lady please.
Squidward: Try reading the sign, Casanova.
[Frankie tries to read the sign, but he can't]
Evelyn: You never learned to read, did you?
Frankie Billy: [sulks] No.
Evelyn: That's all right, neither did I!
Frankie Billy: We were meant for each other! [they walk away happily]
Squidward: [sighs] Even the illiterate are finding love. [takes out a book] Oh, Squidward, why are you torturing yourself with tales of romance? [tosses the book away and it lands in SpongeBob's eye]
SpongeBob: [takes the book out of his eye] Squidward! [puts the book on his tongue] You dropped your ook!
Squidward: That's no "ook". That's just a cruel reminder that I'm single, and likely to remain that way forever.
SpongeBob: Don't be sad, buddy. Turn that frown upside down! [flips Squidward's head]
Squidward: I prefer my frowns in their traditional orientation. [flips his head back to normal]
SpongeBob: [jumps in front of Squidward] Just remember, Squidward. You have never experienced true love. BUT that doesn't mean you will never find it! You know the saying: There's a squid for every pot!
Squidward: Great, let the tired cliches cascade forward. [sarcastically] That'll make me feel better.
[Squilvia walks inside and Squidward gasps]
Squidward: [bashes into SpongeBob and picks him up as he looks at her] Who-who is that? She's got da-da-da-da-da... [melts] She's, wow!
Squilvia: I absolutely adore the decor! Exquisitely minimalist!
Squidward: [gasps] She speaks art jargon!
Squilvia: What culinary delights doth this menu hold?
Squidward: SpongeBob, she's got it all! Class, style, grace, [shows a caricature of Squilvia's face. Elephant sounds are hesrd.] ..and looks only matched by yours truly!
SpongeBob: Well, why don't you ask her out on one of those dates you keep talking about?
Squidward: My next move exactly! Observe the old Tentacles charm in all its glory! [tries to speak to her, but becomes nervous]
Squilvia: Is that Salmonese?
SpongeBob: Boy, you are floundering up there!
Squidward: I don't know what I'm doing! I've never felt like this before.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Squiddy, you've been bitten by the love bug!
Squilvia: Hello! Hello? I'd like to order.
Squidward: She's talking to me. What do I do?
SpongeBob: Squidward, I can help you attract your true love!
Squidward: You!? You don't know the first thing about the fine art of romance!
Squilvia: Well, since no one wants to take my order, I'll go elsewhere. [begins to leave]
Squidward: [gasps] She's leaving!
SpongeBob: Oh no she's not! Hang on, buddy! [cranks up the boat and it moves in front of Squilvia]
Squilvia: Finally, some service around here.
SpongeBob: Hey, Idward Squay. 'Emeber ray the eat day. [Squidward falls over] I believe Squidward here is trying to ask you on a romantic date, ma'am. Right, Squidward?
Squidward: [tries to talk, but is constantly feeling romance]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward. Shake the nice lady's hand and say "Hello."
Squilvia: Hello. [shakes Squidward's hand] My name is Squilvia. Uh... is he okay?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes. He-he's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here. I so admire his work ethic. [Squidward falls over again] So, what do you think? You want to date him?
Squilvia: Uh... I don't know. I'm not too sure...
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! Before you make any hasty decisions, allow me to tell you a few things about my friend, Squidward. Things I think you should know, like that Squidward is by far the single most intelligent person I know.
Squilvia: Intelligent?
SpongeBob: That's right! We are talking some serious credentials.
Squilvia: [reads off certificate] L.A.M.E.? What school is that?
SpongeBob: The point is, he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress.
Squilvia: Really? Wow. He really said that?
SpongeBob: You betcha! He's such a charmer.
Squidward: [to SpongeBob] Don't forget artistic and musical.
SpongeBob: Not to mention that he's an incredible painter, a virtuoso musician, loves to cook and clean and also enjoys gardening quite a bit, too. [Squidward shows a painting of muscular Squidward, shows his playing the clarinet, shows delicious fricassee, cleans SpongeBob with a feather-duster, and waters a flower.]
Squilvia: Oh, he sounds interesting!
SpongeBob: But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward? [teary-eyed] It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend. And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother and very special level. So, how does dinner at 8:00 sound, Squilvia?
Squilvia: I think that sounds perfect. I'll come by your place, okay?
Squidward: Uh-huh.
Squilvia: See you at 8:00, Squidward. [walks away. Squidward floats away and SpongeBob grabs him]
SpongeBob: You okay, buddy. You froze up there, buddy.
Squidward: [Head is in a block of ice, which breaks] What do you mean?
SpongeBob: I mean, when was the last time you went out on a date?
Squidward: [remembers his last date] SpongeBob, you've gotta help me! It's been so long! What do I do?
SpongeBob: You, my friend, are in desperate need of a practice date.
Squidward: That's it! I'll go on... [voice quiets down] a practice date? I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Just meet me at my house at 5:00, Squidward.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob's house. Squidward rings the doorbell]
SpongeBob: [female voice] Just one minute, Squidward!
Squidward: [sulks a little a look at his watch] Sometime today would be nice.
SpongeBob: [dressed as Squilvia. female voice] I'm ready!
Squidward: [screams] Dear Neptune!
SpongeBob: Oh! [smacks his nose, making it bigger, and tilts it down] Missed a spot! [regular voice] Aren't you going to compliment my outfit?
Squidward: Um...You look...stunning?
SpongeBob: [female voice] Oh, you're so sweet! Where are my flowers?
Squidward: What! Oh! Um. Did you drop your lip balm!
SpongeBob: [looks down as Squidward buys some flowers] I don't think I've dropped anything... Ooh! You shouldn't have.
Squidward:  Oh, but I wanted to!
SpongeBob: No, you really shouldn't have. It's just that I'm very... I'm very aller... [sneezes on Squidward] ...very allergic to tulips. Anyway, are you ready to go?
Squidward: Go where?
SpongeBob: To dinner, silly.
Squidward: Oh, right! I'll get my car. [arrives with his boat] Hop in! [SpongeBob clears his throat] What?
SpongeBob: [regular voice] A gentlemen always opens a door for a lady.
Squidward: [opens the door] Oh, where are my manners!? [SpongeBob gets in, and Squidward buckles his seatbelt] Alrighty, so... [SpongeBob is struggling with his seatbelt] Can I help you with that?
SpongeBob: No, no, I've got it!
Squidward: [takes the seatbelt and buckles it] Would you get- There!
SpongeBob: Ah, snug.
Squidward: Uh-huh. Can we go now?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: Great.
SpongeBob: Right after I tinkle. [unbuckles seatbelt, walks inside, and rings a bell before returning to the car] Oh good thing i went, i don’t think i would’ve made it to the restaurant. Is something wrong Squidward?
Squidward: No! Just hungry that’s all.
SpongeBob: Great, well I know a fabulous place! Just head this way.
Squidward: Wonderful.
SpongeBob: Okay now at this stop sign turn right.
Squidward: Okay.
SpongeBob: Now at this light make a right.
Squidward: Gotcha.
SpongeBob: Now at this street here make a right. And at this intersection here make a right, and then park right near the orange building just up ahead. Ooh! We're here!
Squidward: You're a real piece of work, you know that?
SpongeBob: Oh why, thank you, Mr. Squidward! [regular voice] Way to compliment the date, Squidward.
[Bubble transition]
SpongeBob: Now, it's the chit-chat part of the date. Amuse her with an interesting conversation.
Squidward: Oh... Um... Chit-chat... Can you believe this weather we're having?
SpongeBob: Okay, good effort, but you might want to start with something more personal. A woman may like to talk about her day, for example. She may want to talk about her promotion at work, or the wacky antics of her pet snail, or talk about how I was nearly late for our date because I couldn't decide what to wear, and then I didn't really have enough cash to give the lady at the nail salon. [shows SpongeBob's red painted nails]
Squidward: Urrgh!
Patrick: [clears throat] Dinner is served.
SpongeBob: [snoring with Gary] [They both wake up because they hear a noise from outside and look through the window to find Patrick mopping his house.]
Patrick: ♪Makin' it clean, and livin' a dream. Makin' a scene, I'm makin' it clean, I'm makin' it clean. I'm makin' it clean!♪
SpongeBob: Hey, buddy, what are you cleaning for?
Patrick: ‘Cause I'm expecting some very important company.
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Patrick: My big sister, Sam!
SpongeBob: Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!
Patrick: [The music stops abruptly as Patrick drops the mop and starts to look sad.] Nobody does. [gets choked up] I lost her in the surf when we were kids.
SpongeBob: Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick.
Patrick: Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my...[sniffles] my...[sniffles] my... rock! [Patrick bursts into tears, sobbing in despair.]
SpongeBob: It's gonna be okay... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up, buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!
Patrick: Thanks, man, you're right. I can't wait to make up for our lost years!
Squidward: [opens window] Would you two pipe down!
Patrick: Sorry, I was getting my place ready for my sister.
Squidward: Well, I hope she's not as obnoxious as you. [Bus rides up]
Sam: [punches door open and walks towards Patrick thunderously]
Squidward: [closes window fast]
Patrick: ...Sam!
Sam: [Grabs Patrick by the neck and breathes in his face] Brubber!
Patrick: Sis!
Sam: [Starts hugging Patrick very tightly]
Patrick: It's so good to see you.
Sam: You. Sister Sam. Have much catch up to do. [accidentally catapults Patrick into his rock]
Patrick: Wow, you pack a wallop, sis. Sam, this is my best friend, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way. [Both giggling] Yeah long way, heh heh, go back.
Sam: [eyes bug out] Yellow square touch brubber! Make sister Sam mad! [chucks SpongeBob]
Patrick: I cleaned my rock just for you. [Both walk away]
SpongeBob: [Plummets and falls face-flat on the ground]
Patrick: Let’s go inside and play.
Sam: House too small. Make bigger. [pushes rock]
Patrick: Hey, great idea! I'll just go and get some tools and-
Sam: No.
Patrick: Huh?
Sam: I have tools right here. [takes out briefcase and pours out a bunch of sand. Starts making a sand rock]
Squidward: Oh, dear Neptune. Didn't you hear me- [face is pummeled with sand]
Sam: [Walks over sand rock and takes the tv antenna off of Patrick's rock. Puts antenna on sand rock]
Patrick: Thanks, sis!
Sam: Sister Sam loves to make rock for brubber.
Squidward: Well, make rock some where else. My house is full of sand.
Sam: If big nose no like sand, big nose move! [pushes Squidward's house away]
Squidward: This is way beyond my property line. Hey, Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister! [laughs] Construction humor.
Sam: [growls] No laughing!
SpongeBob: No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?
Squidward: Oh, I mean it, alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier.
Sam: [huffing]
SpongeBob: [scared] Oh, Squidward, you jokester.
Sam: [more huffing]
Squidward: Do you think she looks a little... miffed?
Sam: [huffing angrily, then starts crying] Those boys mean! They pick on sister Sam!
Patrick: Shame on you two! Look what you've done!
Squidward: Look what we've done?!
Sam: [crying so hard that her tears fling Squidward and SpongeBob]
Squidward: [falls face first in the sand]
SpongeBob: [flies onto a seahorse-shoe toss pole]
Tuck: Golly-doo-diddley, Clem, that was a nice toss.
Clem: Wasn't me, Tuck. My money's on the little missie over yonder.
Patrick: Awwww, hey, sis, don't listen to those... meanies. Hey, the new rock is looking kinda... boring. What do you say we decorate it?
Sam: Blecorate?
Patrick: You can call it whatever you like, sis, as long as we make it spiffy!
Squidward: [empties sand out of head]
Sam: Make new house spiffy. [takes window off of Squidward's house] Spiffy!
Squidward: Hey, you can't do that, that's my window!
Sam: [puts window on the antenna on the sand rock and laughs] Blecorate.
Patrick: That's the spirit, Sis.
Squidward: Oh no. That is definitely not the spirit, Patrick. Your sister is out of control!
Patrick: Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!
Squidward: You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it! [takes off the antennae-window]
Sam: [dismantles more part from Squidward's house and puts it on the sand rock] More spiffy!
Squidward: But that's from... [looks at his somewhat horribly dismantled house] My house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!
Patrick: How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things...
SpongeBob: Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?
Patrick: No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well! [cries]
SpongeBob: It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-
Sam: Shush! Meanies make brubber's eyes water! [grabs SpongeBob and Squidward] Meanies go home! [Throws them to their homes]
Patrick: Come on, sis. They won't bother us under our rock.
Sam: Meanies is mean. [sand rock closes].
Squidward: [Walks out of his ruined house, gets angry and starts carrying a heavy rock]
SpongeBob: Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.
Squidward: The time for talk is over! Now is the time for action! [walks onto sand rock and holds his rock menacingly over his head] A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the... [grunts] tides of time!
SpongeBob: I don't think you should do that.
Squidward: Who cares what you think?! If it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get! [throws rock, but it bounces off and demolishes the pieces of Squidward’s house on the sand rock. Sand rock opens, flinging Squidward in the air]
Sam: Who makes noise? [sees the broken pieces. screams] Spiffy broken! [Squidward falls] Sister mad!
SpongeBob: Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.
Sam: [picks up broken pieces] Sister Sam rearrange now!
SpongeBob: Please don't.
Sam: [chews up pieces and rapidly spits it out at Squidward's house. Squidward's house then collapses as Squidward looks at it in disbelief]
SpongeBob: Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward? [Squidward is gone] Huh? Must be getting started.
Squidward: [driving bulldozer toward the sand rock. Laughing maniacally]
Patrick and Sam: [shocked] Huh?!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, Squidward stop! [jumps on the bulldozer] Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?
Squidward: Oh, you mean like this? [revs up accelerator, knocking SpongeBob off] Sweeeet destruction!
Sam: [stops the bulldozer. drops Squidward out of the bulldozer and chucks it at SpongeBob's house, destroying it] That'll teach those meanies.  
Patrick: Your still my rock big, sis.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.
Patrick: SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?
SpongeBob: She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
Patrick: Well, I guess she can get a little carried away.
Sam: What Patrick doing? Why Patrick talk to meanies?
Patrick: Well uh...well...well it's about your temper, Sam.
Sam: No have temper! That make sister Sam SO mad! Sister Sam put on mean face! [turns face around with an angrier face] Now smash brubber's house! [picks up the sand rock]
Patrick: Not the rock! [jumps on the sand rock while Sam pummels it]
Sam: [slams the ground and yells. Her regular face then sees Patrick hurt and unconscious] Patrick? Little Brubber? Little Brubber no wake.
SpongeBob: Patrick? [takes out cookie dough]
Patrick: [sniffs it and eats it as he wakes up] Cookie Dough!
Sam: Patrick Ok! Sister Sam feel bad. Sorry she hurt Patrick. Should protect little brubber. She go now. [walks away]
Patrick: Sis, wait! Hold on! Aw, don't feel sad. You don't have go!
Sam: Yes, Sister Sam must go. Late for manicure. [hugs Patrick tightly again] Bye, brubber!
Patrick: Bye, sis.
Sam: [bus drives up and she punches another hole, but next to the door]
[The bus leaves.]
Patrick: Isn't my sister something?
SpongeBob: Aw, she's something, all right! [laughs]
Narrator: The first day of spring in Bikini Bottom. The flowers are blooming, the rainbows are... how you say? Bowing. The jellyfish are buzzing, [flowers grow all over SpongeBob's house, covering it] and it's time for the traditional...
SpongeBob: Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?
Gary: Meow! [Gary meows in pain. SpongeBob is singing while using Gary as a vacuum cleaner to clean up his house]
SpongeBob: Thanks for your help, Gare!
Gary: Meow!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?
Patrick: It's Spring Cleaning Day?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!
[Patrick runs through his pile of junk to get a cotton swab]
Patrick: Found it! Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob! [Patrick cleans his belly button] See ya again next spring. [notices trash can] Whatcha got in your trash can? Huh!? You're throwing this away!? The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
Patrick: Oh! Some people just don't understand sentimental value. [gasps] You're throwing away Pete!? Y-You can't part with a keepsake! That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake! Hmph! Why, I'm disgusted! It's time you re-evaluate your priorities.
SpongeBob: Hmm. Maybe Patrick is right. All of these things do hold precious memories. [garbage man tries to take junk. SpongeBob gasps] No! [tries to take his junk back] Come on, you! [continues to pull] Gotcha! Welcome home, precious memories. [puts back his junk and saves empty box of Kelpo and toy wrapper] Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?
Gary: Meow! [Gary is on top of old newspaper]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab] Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special.
Squidward: Oh, dear me. I know. I hope I never forget this moment.
SpongeBob: You're right. I'm going to need something to preserve the memory.
SpongeBob: Oh, perfect! [SpongeBob keeps the Krabby Patties grease] Ah, memories. Greasy memories.
SpongeBob: Whoo-wee! Nothing like a hard day of work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward? Whew!
[SpongeBob saves his work sweat]
Squidward: You're sentimental about your sweat?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!
Squidward: Okay, this is getting creepy now.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, better get these precious memories home.
Squidward: Officially creeped out now.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob singing]♪Memories, doo doo doo memories, doo doo doo doo memories.♪ [opens his door while all of his junk is there] Hey, Gary. [Gary is on top of more old newspaper trying to eat his food. SpongeBob going up the stairs with junk in his wagon] Oh. Safe and sound! [SpongeBob's junk almost falls down, but SpongeBob closes the door before it falls down] Whoo, closed up tight! And you said it wouldn't fit. [all of SpongeBob's junk falls out]
Gary: Meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything.
[SpongeBob looks outside]
SpongeBob: Like the front yard!
[Squidward is sleeping and gets up by the clock. Squidward gasps when he sees SpongeBob's junk. Squidward opens his door when all of SpongeBob's junk is in the way. Squidward knocks on SpongeBob's door]
SpongeBob: Who is it? [in a singing voice]
Squidward: It's Squidward.
SpongeBob: How do I know it's you?
Squidward: Open the door, nitwit!
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?
Squidward: You can certainly help... [Squidward looks at SpongeBob] Why are you wearing garbage?
SpongeBob: Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning.
Squidward: Dress? It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt. If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police.
SpongeBob: Ah, not the sanitation police! You don't understand, these things aren't junk! They're my friends, like this little guy, [SpongeBob crying at a light bulb] Alfred the light bulb. Oh, we had a great time together, Al, reading, paying the bills. Why is it the ones who glow brightest burn out the soonest?! [SpongeBob starts to cry] You will be missed.
Squidward: Touching. Still creepy, but touching. Time to make a phone call. [cops come]
Cop 1: Sanitation police! This is a raid. Step away from the refuse.
Squidward: Thank goodness you're here, officer.
Cop: Is this your filthy home?
Squidward: No, it's not my home! It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!
SpongeBob: Hi!
Cop 1: Thanks for the information, citizen.
Cop 2: [To Squidward] Hmph, snitch.
Cop 1: Do your duty, Sergeant.
Cop 2: [Puts a sticker that reads "COMDEMNED" on SpongeBob's house]
Cop 1: This residence is now comdemned.
SpongeBob: Condemned? What does that mean?
Cop 1: Condemned means this house is unfit to live in. You'll have to vacate the home immediately.
SpongeBob: Vacate? You mean I have to move?
Cop 1: Anything that is a threat to public health must be condemned. Sergeant.
Cop 2: [Puts a sticker that reads "CONDEMNED" on the trashbag on SpongeBob's head]
Squidward: Thank you again, officers.
SpongeBob: Wait! Please don't condemn my house.
Squidward: Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law. We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow.
Cop 1: I'll request a commendation for you.
Squidward: Really?
Cop 1: Right after we condemn your house!
Squidward: My house?!
Cop 1: Yes! It's as filthy as your neighbor's. [Shows Squidward's house from the outside being as dirty as SpongeBob's]
SpongeBob: But isn't there anything we can do?
Cop 1: You can evacuate the premises or throw away your junk.
SpongeBob: Throw them away?
Cop 1: Thank you for the attempt, ma'am.
Squidward: Ma'am? It's a nightshirt! [the cops leave] This is all your fault! You have to get rid of your junk right now!
SpongeBob: I know. [crying] I'm gonna miss them so much! [continues crying]
Squidward: You really miss them?
SpongeBob: No. I'll be strong. [continues crying again]
Squidward: Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk... uh, friends before you toss them away.
SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Squidward! Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my... remember my precious little babies!
Squidward: Creepy.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward, the latter with his hat on and the former holding it, as the garbage man takes the junk away. He elbows Squidward to get his attention, and then points to his head to remind him to take his hat off.]
Squidward: [mutters under his breath] Oh, good grief. [takes his hat off]
[SpongeBob sniffles as the garbage man takes the last can of junk away and throws it into the truck. SpongeBob walks over to him, holding up some dollar bills.]
SpongeBob: Your pay, my good man. 
[The garbage man takes the money and gets into the truck. SpongeBob sniffs again as the truck begins to drive back to the dump.]
SpongeBob: [fighting back tears] Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump! 
[the garbage truck drives away] 
Squidward: Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed. 
SpongeBob: Alright, nighty-night. 
Squidward: Idiot. [opens his door full of photos. He sees a picture of Pete] What the...?! SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk? 
SpongeBob: Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house. [He opens the door too filled with photos and Patrick appears sliding with photos] 
Patrick: Nice dress. 
Squidward: [getting angry] It's a nightshirt!
Patrick: [walking] So why are we going to Sandy's house?
SpongeBob: To see her vacation slides for the hu.. [gets smacked in face by door] Ow!
ZDS Agent: [Walking out the door with his partner and the slides] We got the slides, sir.
Patrick: Who?...What?...Why?
[The both get dragged in by Sandy]
Sandy: [Taking SpongeBob and Patrick] Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think... [She pulls a tree trunk lever to activate a secret hideout] You see, [puts the two on two chairs. She goes to a copy of the vacation slides] Someone already made six copies.
[SpongeBob raises his hand]
Sandy: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Who is this someone? Do we know him?
Sandy: By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob. [Patrick raises his hand] Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing.
[SpongeBob raises his hand again]
Sandy: [tying up SpongeBob and Patrick with rope] Okay, no more questions until the end of the slideshow. Okay? [they nod in agreement] Good. [shows the first slide] The first slide is of me getting some last-minute readings before I took off on my vacation. [switches to the next slide] And this is me giving the thumbs-up-goodbye for now salute. [shows the next slide] And this... [dreadfully] This is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit. 
[transition to SpongeBob visiting Sandy]
SpongeBob: [walking to Sandy's house] ♪I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy [spinning] I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell♪ [rings the doorbell; suddenly, an extreme humming noise vibrates the ocean floor] Sandy...! [a rocket emerges from beneath the ground] Whoa!
Sandy: What do you think of my moon wagon?
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?
Sandy: Oh no, SpongeBob. That's what you call a "coincidence." I'm getting ready for my vacation!
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
Sandy: The moon! [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: You're going on a moon trip?!
Sandy: Yep! I'm all packed up and ready to go. Wanna help me…
SpongeBob: I'll be right back!
Sandy: ...load up the moon wagon? [sighs]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is at bakery] Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number. [attempts to pull a ticket, but fails and gets tangled up]
Bakerman: Number 12.
SpongeBob: Yes, I'm Number 12!
Bakerman: What can I get for you today?
SpongeBob: I need a bon voyage sheet cake. [Bakerman brings out out sheet cake] Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! "Have fun on the moon...". What rhymes with "moon"? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?
Bakerman: How about “loon?”
SpongeBob: I got it! "See you soon!”
Countdown: [SpongeBob heads back to Sandy’s dome with the cake. The rocket is a few seconds from takeoff] T-minus 12, 11, 10, 9, 8…
SpongeBob: No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake! [grabs a hold of the ladder, but falls into the rocket] Whoa!
Sandy: [sees SpongeBob] SpongeBob? What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?
SpongeBob: [panting, and out of breath] I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and…
Countdown: Launch commencing.
Sandy: Never mind. Can't stop the countdown now. Better strap yourself down. Looks like you're going on a mooncation!
SpongeBob: I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip! [rocket takes off] Hey, Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy...
Sandy: Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight.
SpongeBob: Oh, I just wanted to show you the…
Sandy: for the afterburners! [activates afterburners; propels rocket further] What were you saying, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I… brought you a “bon voyage” sheet cake.
Sandy: You can't bring regular food into space!
SpongeBob: Wha, wha, wha, why not?
Sandy: Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!
SpongeBob: Oh. Is that a bad thing?
Sandy: Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive. [cake floats into the reverse spatial linearity drive. The rocket engine malfunctions and turns off] Ah nuts!
SpongeBob: Oops. Sorry, Sandy.
Sandy: [presses "Toss" button, and gets dressed in a large space suit] Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation! Now, try not to file anything else up while I'm saving our necks. [goes into space] Aha! There's our problem. [clears the cake out from the the reverse spatial linearity drive.] Eh, could've used more nuts. [comes back inside rocket] Okay. I've got her up and running, again. Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Roger that! Folding hands.
Sandy: Now, get ready for lunar module se…
SpongeBob: [folds hands into a bird] What do you think Sandy?
Sandy: Just don't touch anything while we separate.
SpongeBob: Ok.
Sandy: [detaches rocket from boosters] That looks like a good spot. [lands on the moon, sets camp up] Alright, SpongeBob. Now that our camp is set up, it's time for some moon crater boarding! [brings out boards]
SpongeBob: What's moon crater boarding?
Sandy: You ride these on that like this. [jumps on and rides her snowboard on the moon] Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah. [flips her board in midair] Right there is the classic Texas tail grab. [grabs tail, and twists it into the shape of Texas] And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop. [spins and breaks an asteroid into an acorn and eats it] Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite: The Tour de Saturn. [lies down on Saturn's rings] Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn.
SpongeBob: Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.
Sandy: Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn.
SpongeBob: I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try. [jumps on board and floats off into space] Sandy, this doesn't seem right.
Sandy: Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this! [lassos asteroid to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [grabs onto asteroid] Ok. [the rock pulls SpongeBob to the moon surface. SpongeBob begins to surf the moon, but screams]
Sandy: Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick? [SpongeBob keeps screaming] Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a “Waaaaah!”
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob continues screaming, and begins to surf over a satellite] Hey, this is kind of fun! [leaps, and bounces off the satellite, damaging it]
Frankie Billy: [shifts to Patrick watching TV] Carol, your real father is… [TV goes out due to satellite damage]
Patrick: Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!
SpongeBob: [scene returns to SpongeBob] Watch this Sandy! [ties an asteroid to his helmet to hold him down] Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up… [accidentally smashes into rocket's fuel tank, making it leak] puncture into the side of the rocket.
Sandy: You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the "no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket.”
SpongeBob: Oops!
Sandy: Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!
SpongeBob: Wait! I have to do something very important! [takes picture of himself “holding the earth”] There! [both go into the rocket, and head for earth] So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?
Sandy: If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic. [rocket fuel signs shows “Empty”. Rocket starts falling to earth] Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!
SpongeBob: Is that bad?
Sandy: [unbuckles seatbelt] Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball “bad”.
SpongeBob: Well, in that case, I won’t… giant fireball?! [unbuckles seatbelt, but hits wall] Sandy, where are you going?
Sandy: 'm going to take this bull by the horns! [Lassos the nose of the rocket. Rocket begins to catch fire as it descends towards earth]
SpongeBob: Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?
Sandy: Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere. [the rocket keeps falling at a faster rate. SpongeBob yells in terror] Yeehaw!
SpongeBob: [continues screaming] My goodness!
Sandy: Yeehaw! Yeehaw! [rockets crashes]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay? [Sandy groans] Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation.
Sandy: Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes.
Both of them: [laugh]
Mr. Krabs: Who's ready for some excitement?
SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Pearl: We are! [Squidward is sitting idly by]
Mr. Krabs: Who is ready for some fun?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We are!
Mr. Krabs: Who's ready to look at some vacation pictures?
Patrick and Sandy: We... huh?
Mr. Krabs: [turns off lights and turns on slideshow and turns it to a picture of a dollar] I'm sure you know this charming fellow! [changes slide to him catching money] Here's the one that almost got away! [changes slide to a pile of money] Look at these pile towers of golden green! [changes slide to the Krusty Krab] Here's how the whole thing started! [cuts to flashback]
Squidward: That will be $6.75 please. [Takes money from the customer]
Mr. Krabs: [on a loud speaker] Attention! Attention, all employees of the Krusty Krab! Report immediately to the main office!
Squidward: [walks off]
Frankie Billy: Hey! What about my change?
SpongeBob: [Appears from the door to Mr. Krabs' office] You called Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: That's right. You better have a seat laddy. Gentlemen! I have an announcement to make. As of tomorrow, I'm closing the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: Hallelujah! [Charges out the door]
SpongeBob: [In shock gasping]
Mr. Krabs: Relax, boy! I'm just going on vacation for a few days. [Moves next to SpongeBob who is still in shock] Yesiree, laddy! I think the old Krusty Krab can afford a few days in dried up while I take little Pearl to a long, overdue vacation. And I was kinda hoping, that you come along with us, SpongeBob. [echo many times] Come along with us, SpongeBob. Come along with us...For a nominal fee of course. So, what do think, boy?
SpongeBob: [Smiles brightly]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? [Starts shaking SpongeBob] SpongeBob!?
SpongeBob: [His eyes who are now like Magic 8 Balls show "Yes" and "Please"] Yes! Please!
Mr. Krabs: Great! We'll have some fun! [Laughs and SpongeBob falls over]
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' house]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, my dear! Are you all packed and ready to go?
Pearl: You bet your bottom dollar!
Mr. Krabs: Me bottom dollar? Why I never do that!
Pearl: It's just an expression daddy. I just mean I'm really excited! [Walks outside with Mr. Krabs and spots SpongeBob] Gasp!
SpongeBob: La la la la la la la la la!
Pearl: Daddy! One of your employees is in the back seat!
SpongeBob: [Singing] 🎵Going on vacation with Mr. Krabs! Going on vacation with his daughter Pearl! Going on vacation with the whole Krabs clan! La la la la la la!🎵 I'm a vaaacation man! [Stops singing and spots Mr. Krabs and Pearl] Hey travel buddies!
Pearl: Daddy! I thought this was supposed to be OUR family vacation!?
Mr. Krabs: Eh... It still is! SpongeBob's... like a son to me! Plus he'll pay a top dollar to tag along.
SpongeBob:  [notices Pearl walk closer to Mr. Krabs' boat] Hi Pearl! Looks like you and I get to spend some quality time together!
Pearl: You know, SpongeBob. We got an old family tradition of having our guests ride on the floor with the luggage until we leave town! [throws her suitcase at SpongeBob knocking him to the floor]
SpongeBob: [Raises arm up which is bent] I will happily honor this family tradition.
Mr. Krabs: See? You two are already having fun together! [laughs and drives off past SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick's houses]
Squidward: [Laying on a chair] And there they go! Two whole days of no work and no SpongeBob! This is almost too good to be true! Nothing can possibly go wrong!
Patrick: [Appears behind Squidward] Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
SpongeBob: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Did you hear something?
Pearl: Just the sound of this vacation dying!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, cheer up pumpkin puss! We're almost there!
SpongeBob: [Raises arm] Um, is time to come up yet?
Pearl: Sure, why not? Join the funeral. Super Mega Mall World? Is that where we going?
Mr. Krabs: Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better! [Drives past Super Mega Mall World]
SpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs? Think we could make a bathroom stop?
Mr. Krabs: But we are making such great time! Try to hold it a little longer lad!
Pearl: Holly molly! We're going to Planet Rollercoaster! [Mr. Krabs drives past it] But, daddy? W-why aren't we stopping?
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] The place we are going is 100 times better than that old amusement park!
SpongeBob: Is it Bathroom Land? 'Cause I could really use a bathroom right now!
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] Bathroom Land! Oh SpongeBob! You kill me!
Pearl: Yeah! He's a real chuckle factory. [laughs sarcastically]
Mr. Krabs: [Continues driving] Ok, kids! We're just about there! Just over that hill, is the greatest sight in the sea! Now close your eyes for a big surprise!
Pearl: [closes eyes and crosses fingers] Teenage Boy Museum! Teenage Boy Museum!
SpongeBob: [Closes eyes and crosses legs] Bathroom! Bathroom!
Mr. Krabs: [Stops driving] Ok! We're here! You can open your eyes now!
Pearl: [she and SpongeBob open their eyes] Yay! The Teenage Boy Museum! [a wrecking ball suddenly knocks down the Teenage Boy Museum] It was right there!
Mr. Krabs:  Oh... that's okay, honey. We weren't going there anyway. THAT'S where we're going!
Pearl: Gasp!
Mr. Krabs: It's the Bikini Bottom Mint! Where they make all of the money! Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in all of your life?
Mr. Krabs: Well, laddy! Looks like it's just you and me! And of course, the Mint! [Hearts in eyes fly off]
[Bubble transition to inside the Bikini Bottom Mint]
Mr. Krabs: Is this the most exciting day in you life?
SpongeBob: Not really.
SpongeBob: Bill? [Laughs]
Bill: And yes... I am aware of the hilarious irony between my name and my job. Now, I'll be your tour guide for today. This tour will take you through the entire money process.
Mr. Krabs: You hear that, boy? [Eyes in SpongeBob's face] The entire money making... process!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I... [Takes Mr. Krabs' eyes off his face] ...sure did sir!
Bill: [Leading the crowd] This just to your right is the first part of the dollar making process. [Shows the crowd people behind the glass window operating a pressing machine] Where very special sheets of paper are prepped for...
Mr. Krabs: Guah guah guah guah guah! [Starts licking the glass window]
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is starting at us. [Shakes Mr. Krabs] Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper!
Mr. Krabs: Just paper? That's like saying the ocean is just water! Or, or the Krabby Patty's just a... a... a sandwich!
Bill: Ahem...
Mr. Krabs: Oh! [Dusts off SpongeBob] Uh... uh...
Bill: [Walks the crowd to a new area] And in this area here to my left, we see the process in which the sheets of silver are pressed into... [The machine then pounds the silver sheet into coins] ...shiny blank coins which are collected in back of one million pieces for the coining press.
Mr. Krabs: Wuh wuh wuh... o-o-one million shiny pieces of... [His eyes start to inflate] silver coins? [His eyes explode with the pieces flying]
Bill:  They call... [Gets hit in the face by pieces of Mr. Krabs' eyes and the rest hit the other tourists]
SpongeBob: Uh oh! I thought this might happen! [Takes out a box that says "Replacement Eyes" and screws the eyes into Mr. Krabs and turns him on]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Anytime sir! Oh! The tour's leaving without us! [Points to Bill and the others moving forward]
Bill:  [Talking with the tourists]
SpongeBob: We better catch up with them before we miss something, right Mr. Krabs? [Notices Mr. Krabs is gone and looks over] Gasp! [Sees Mr. Krabs on the conveyor belt getting ready to be crushed by the machine] MR. KRABS!
Mr. Krabs: He he he he!
SpongeBob: [Pushes Mr. Krabs out of the way but gets crushed instead turning into many coins] I'm not sure how I feel about this sudden change! [Laughs] Good one, huh, Mr. Krabs? AHHH! [Reforms back together] Watch out, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [Holding a coin and moving down the conveyor belt] Hello! My name is Eugene! What's yours? [A machine with a needle makes the face on one coin and moves up towards it] Do you believe in love at first sight?
SpongeBob: [Swings by and saves Mr. Krabs] Phew... that was close.
Mr. Krabs: I'd say! I almost had that quarter's phone number!
Mr. Krabs: Pretty neat, huh, boy? That's where they... [Claw pops and his whole arm deflates] ...DESTROY MONEY!?!? NOOO! [Charges to the shredder looking at the shredded money] NOOO! WHY? WHY? [Starts crying a fountain]
SpongeBob:  [Puts buckets on both sides of Mr. Krabs] It's okay, sir. I'm sure I...
Mr. Krabs: [Arms and nose pop off as he continues to cry from all ends, starting to flood the Mint]
SpongeBob: Wah oh! [Feet turn into propellers and he swims toward Mr. Krabs turning a knob on him which stops him from crying then sucks up all of the tears and tries to spit them out the window but goes through the wall instead.]
SpongeBob: [Finishes spitting]
Mr. Krabs: [Rocking on the ground speaking gibberish]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! It's okay! [Picks up Mr. Krabs] The shredded money is recycled and turned into brand, new money! See? [Shows Mr. Krabs the new dollars being made]
Mr. Krabs: It's a miracle!
SpongeBob: Yay!
Skinny Robber: Take care of them!
Muscular Robber: No problem, boss! [Growls and moves toward the crowd]
Mr. Krabs: [Jumps in] Oh no you don't! You filthy dollar wrestler! [Throws SpongeBob at the Muscular Robber, which has no effect]
SpongeBob: That didn't work at all! [Falls to the ground]
Muscular Robber: Grrrr...
Mr. Krabs: Grrrr... YAHHH! [Charges at the Muscular Robber and knocks him into the Skinny Robber. Uses SpongeBob to tie them up, then tosses them through the ceiling and into a police car]
Mr. Krabs: Good work, boy!
SpongeBob: You, too, sir!
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Oooooo...
Bill: [Gives them their dollars]
SpongeBob: Wow! It's-
Mr. Krabs: [Takes it] Mine! I haven't charged you yet for tagging along on me vacation!
Mr. Krabs:  [Starts to cry] Shoes?
SpongeBob: Oh no... [Puts on rain clothes]
Mr. Krabs: [Bursts out bawling]
[The episode ends with the Bikini Bottom Mint spraying out Mr. Krabs' tears]
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber.
Mr. Krabs: Good job, laddy, another fruitful day pushing patties.
SpongeBob: Push-a-what?
Mr. Krabs: You know, turning patties into lettuce. [Bites a pickle]
SpongeBob: Uh, I'm not following you.
Mr. Krabs: Cabbage, green backs, money!
SpongeBob: Oh, you mean your obsession.
Mr. Krabs: Obsession is kind of a strong word. [opens the safe and puts the money to bed] Sleep tight, me little angels. [closes the safe and leaves with SpongeBob and turns out the light]
[Plankton climbs out of the pickle jar and opens a fake pickle, which contains a plunger launching device. He assembles it and shoots it at the wall above the safe, then climbs the rope, lowers himself onto the combination spinner and spins it by running on the top of the dial]
Plankton: 35 left, 25 right, and finally, 4 left. Open, says me! [pulls, but nothing happens] Hey, what gives? I was looking right at the combination, why isn't it opening?
Mr. Krabs: [Comes in] What's going on in here? Hmm, Everything seems to be in order. The safe is still safe. Huh, I must be hearing things. Hey, how'd that pickle end up on the floor? [picks Plankton up] Now, what was that rule about dropped food? Was it 5 seconds or 5 minutes or... ah, well. Waste not, whnt not.
Narrator: Approximately 10 hours later
[In the Chum Bucket]
Karen: Plankton, where have you been?!
Plankton: Trust me, you do not want to know.
Karen: Did you get the Krabby Patty formula? Like I have to ask.
Plankton: No, and I probably never will.
Karen: You need a more positive outlook!
Plankton: Oh, Karen, if only you could just see things way I do. [Remembers when a fish, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Patrick squished him by stepping on him]
Karen: [Gasps] Plankton!
Plankton: What?
Karen: I think you hit it! You couldn't see the correct combination because you have only one eye. You lack depth perception.
Plankton: Maybe you're right. That would explain why I stink at darts.
Karen: What you need is a second eye.
Plankton: Karen, my dear, I think you're on to something. Looks like it's time for an upgrade!
[Plankton presses a button. A machine covers him then retracts. An eye appears on the side of Plankton's head.]
Plankton: [eye appears] Success! [another eye grows] Uh oh, that ain't good. [even more eyes grows] No, no, no, no no no nо nо nо no! I can see every- [an eye grows inside of him and pops out of his mouth]
[Cut to Plankton screwing a brace onto his head]
Plankton: Binocular vision, here I come!  [presses the button again and an eye grows in the correct place this time. It grows legs] What? Oh mamma! Stop, I command you! [it begins to walk, firing a laser beam] Oh, come on, please stop! [Karen stops it] Next.
[Cut to Plankton hobbling about, injured]
Plankton: Karen, what am I doing wrong?
Karen: Your experiments are missing essential one ingredient.
Plankton: It's not love, is it? ‘Cause you know I hate that stuff.
Karen: No, it's cells from another eye. Even a single teardrop would contain enough DNA.
Plankton: Tears, huh? I guess if I have to. [Stabs his foot with a crutch and cries] Ow! Will these do?
Karen: No, silly. They have to be from somebody who already has two eyes.
Plankton: Two eyes, huh? I think I know a crybaby who fits that description!
[Cut to SpongeBob setting up a picnic]
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton!
Plankton: [jumps onto lunchbox] Hey, SpongeBob, want to hear a sad story?
SpongeBob: No, not particularly.
Plankton: Once upon a time, there was a yellow doofus who loved to drink milk with his lunch. But unfortunately for said doofus, his milk was tragically spilt.[Knocks the milk over]The end.
SpongeBob: [Starts to cry] S-s-s-sad story! And so timely! [SpongeBob cries uncontrollably, Plankton catches his tears in a bag]
Plankton: Get a grip!
SpongeBob: Well, I guess Plankton's right. Good thing I always bring backup milk! [Opens his face like a refrigerator and pulls out another carton of milk]
[bubble transition to Plankton tied to a table in his lab]
Karen: Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Plankton: Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with! [a needle lowers, fills with the tear sample then hovers above Plankton's eye] Mommy! Here comes the pain! [the needle drops some of the liquid onto Plankton's eye, then retracts] That wasn't so bad. Uh-oh, here we go. [his eye splits in two] Eureka!
Karen: So, does it work?
Plankton: You tell me. [Throws a dart and hits bullseye] Bullseye! Now for my next target – the Krabby Patty secret formula! [Leaves The Chum Bucket] Hahahaha! [skids to a halt] Wha-? [everything is bouncing and has a smiley face] Why does everything look so weir- ... look so beautiful!
SpongeBob: La la la la!
Plankton: Hi, SpongeBob, great to see you, buddy!
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton, whatcha doing?
Plankton: I thought I was going to steal something. Can't imagine why. So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day! [he skips away]
SpongeBob: Okay, buh-bye!
[Plankton walks back into the Chum Bucket with an ice cream and a balloon]
Plankton: Honey, I'm home!
Karen: Oh, you're a happy camper. Did you finally steal the formula?
Plankton: Formula, what formula? [Drops ice cream] I forgot the formula! I can't imagine what got into me.
Karen: It's that new eye of yours. Your evil DNA has become corrupted by SpongeBob's nice DNA. You've gone from evil.. To neevil! You're becoming as harmless as that fry cook.
Plankton: Nonsense, You're imagining things.
Karen: Oh, really? Let's test it, shall we? Tell me what you see in these ink blots. [Holds one up that looks like a bat]
Plankton: Hmm. Looks like a pretty butterfly!
Karen: Nope. Try again. What does this remind you of? [Picture of snake]
Plankton: Aww, it's a little puppy doggy!
Karen: Try this! [Picture of nuclear explosion]
Plankton: Uhh...
Karen: I'll give you a hint. [Makes explosion sound]
Plankton: A bouquet of flowers! Would you like some flowers, honey?
Karen: Cells from that sponge have changed your whole point of view.
Plankton: Ah, a few blobs of ink doesn't prove a thing. I'm as evil as ever, I'll prove it right now by stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula. [Runs outside]
[A building is on fire and citizens are screaming; Bubble Bass is trapped on the top floor, waving his arms]
Plankton: Such lovely destruction!
Bubble Bass: Help! Save me! [sips soda] Save me!
Plankton: I'll help you! Do not worry, citizen, I'll catch you!
Bubble Bass: Comin' down.
Plankton: Oh no. [Bubble Bass sits on him, squashing Plankton.]
Bubble Bass: Thanks, buddy!
Plankton: Unbelievable! I've committed another selfless act. This eye is taking over! But I must stay strong and concentrate on swiping the Krabby Patty formula. [A bottle rolls toward him] What's this? It's the Krabby Patty formula! Uh-wha.. Krabs must have lost it!
Mr. Krabs: [Standing at a bus stop with SpongeBob] And that's why your promotion means a 50% cut in salary, understand, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs! [Salutes]
Plankton: Hey, Eugene! You missing anything? [Holds out the formula]
Mr. Krabs: Me Krabby Patty Formula!
Plankton: That's right, Krabs. Unbelievably, I found it lying on the ground! [Laughs] So I'm giving it back to you, take it.
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Something smells and it isn't my long johns. [Takes formula back] Let's see here, you had the formula, why didn't you run off with it?
Plankton: Why didn't I run off with it? Why didn't I run off with it? Because that would be stealing!
Mr. Krabs: Since when do you care about stealing?
Plankton: Oh, it's this cursed new eye! I've got to get rid of it! Must become monocular again. [Tries to squeeze his eyes together] Hahaha, I did it! [They separate again. He tries to pull the eye off of his face, but he falls over.]
Mr. Krabs: You know, I don't think I trust this nice, polite, pleasant Plankton.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed. He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh. [Walks away]
[Plankton returns to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: My life of evil is over. [Tries to fix eyes] Hey, why is it so dark in here?
[Lights turn on to reveal a surprise party]
Everybody: Surprise!
Plankton: [Screams]The Chum Bucket's been invaded. I'll never surrender, never!
SpongeBob: [Laughs] This isn't an invasion, we're here to show you how much we appreciate all the good deeds you've done lately. We came to give a great big hug!
Plankton: What, no! Not hugs! [Plankton screams and they hug him and the new eye pops out and Plankton looks in a mirror] It's gone. That disgustingly good eye is finally gone! I'm cured! Thank you, thank you all! Especially you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, glad I could help.
Plankton: Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation, I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security attack lasers! [Presses a button and lasers start shooting. Everybody screams in terror and run away. Plankton laughs.] Oh, well. Depth perception's overrated anyway. [Turns to enter the lab, but walks into the door and falls over]
SpongeBob: [walking to Sandy's Treedome] Boy, I can't wait to show Sandy my new karate moves, [laughs] oh, Sandy, aaah... [sees Sandy with Fuzzy Acorns] Sandy is in trouble. Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming to save you! [flies then digs to Sandy's Treedome, but is stopped by Fuzzy Acorn's stinky feet.]
Fuzzy Acorns: Who is this intruder that fails to attack me?
Sandy: That's my friend: SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Whoa...what was that stench?
Fuzzy Acorns: That is what we in karate call; the Smell of Death!
SpongeBob: [gets up] You know kah-ra-tay?
Sandy: He just doesn't know karate, he IS karate. [Fuzzy Acorns takes down a fly using his eyebrows] He is the legendary karate master, Fuzzy Acorns. Fuzzy is here to test me for the highest belt in karate.
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, you already have a black belt.
Sandy: Yes, but there's one even higher than that! [points to Fuzzy Acorns' belt] The blacker belt!
SpongeBob: Gee...I wish I had a karate belt
Fuzzy Acorns: [quickly moves beside SpongeBob] If you want a belt, you must earn it.
SpongeBob: Okay? How do I do that?
Fuzzy Acorns: You got caught in the eyes? What do you think I'm here for!?
SpongeBob: Hm?
Fuzzy Acorns: I am the mighty oak, and you are but a sapling!
SpongeBob: Um...sorry. I'm confused.
Fuzzy Acorns: I am here to separate that wheat from the chaff! No? [SpongeBob shakes his head] That last one usually works...
Sandy: What Fuzzy is trying to say is that he is here to judge whether anyone is worthy of getting a karate belt or not.
SpongeBob: But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?
Fuzzy Acorns: It is simple. I conduct a series of tests, and if you pass, [takes out a red belt] I'll give you a belt that shows you know karate.
[bubble transition to a log on two blocks]
Fuzzy Acorns: The first test is simple. Split a log with one hand chop, like so. [easily chops the log in half] Your turn, [places another log down] Karate Man.
SpongeBob: [walks over to the log] Mm-mmm! Yeah, okay.
Fuzzy Acorns: Please proceed.
SpongeBob: Okay! Prepare to see the split of your life! [jumps onto the log but ends up splitting himself in half]
[bubble transition to Fuzzy Acorns holding a stick]
Fuzzy Acorns: Mastery of this test will show me you're ready for the next level of karate-dom! [shouts while swinging the stick around] Alright, your turn! [gives SpongeBob the stick]
SpongeBob: In turn I will! [laughs]
Fuzzy Acorns: Just do the thing with the thing please! [SpongeBob jumps onto Sandy's wheel and starts to ride around on it while Nat Peterson is seen playing a piano and SpongeBob runs into Sandy] We shall settle this on the battlefield tomorrow! You two will fight each other! If I see you have the skill of real hand-to-hand combat, I will award you with karate belts. [takes out two karate belts then puts them back] Otherwise, you get nothing. [jumps up into the tree]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait! Sensei!
Fuzzy Acorns: No more talk! Only do!
Sandy: [leads SpongeBob out of her tree dome] Better run on home and practice SpongeBob! See you tomorrow! [closes the door]
[bubble transition to SpongeBob running up and down stairs. He then lifts weights and runs up stairs more getting tired. SpongeBob karate chops a brick wall but he ends up breaking apart. SpongeBob then walks up more stairs but falls toward the bottom after nearly reaching the top. He then punches a punching bag but punches it too hard and it slams into him.]
Narrator: Early the next morning...
SpongeBob: My match! [tries to open his door but he cannot get a grip on it] I can't get outta here!
Gary: Meow...[opens the door using his mouth]
SpongeBob: [runs out of his house] Thanks Gary!
Gary: Meow meow.
[bubble transition to Sandy's Treedome]
Fuzzy Acorns: Where is the soft one!? That match starts in...[looks at his watch which resembles an abacus] Right now!
SpongeBob: Here...I'm right here...[has a tired expression on his face] I've readied myself...into a full state of readiness...and I am ready...to be ready...I'm so tired...I'm so tired...so very tired...
Sandy: You sure you want to do this buddy?
Fuzzy Acorns: Enough talk! If you want your belt, you gonna have to tussle it out! So let the match begin!
[SpongeBob slowly chops at Sandy but she easily grabs his arm and chops it]
SpongeBob: Alright! Brace yourself Sandy! 'Cause it's about to get rough and tumble!
Sandy: [quickly moving behind and in front of SpongeBob] Okay, SpongeBob! You gotta catch me first! [SpongeBob starts to spin around and she forces him into the ground]
Fuzzy Acorns: Most impressive, Sandy. But I am here to evaluate SpongeBob. [grabs SpongeBob with his foot] Let's see what he can do on the offensive! [tosses SpongeBob toward Sandy but she grabs him in midair and tosses him into a tree]
SpongeBob: Okay Sandy! [karate chops a picnic table and jumps onto the wooden pieces close to Sandy] Prepare for my finishing move! I call it The Sleeper! [falls asleep on the table]
Sandy: Huh?
Fuzzy Acorns: Very good, Sandy! You put your opponent to sleep in under a minute! [touches the table and it falls apart causing SpongeBob to wake up] Too bad your opponent didn't put up a fight. I was prepared to give you the lowest of belts, [takes out a transparent belt] The Clear Belt! [chuckles] But now, I realize you're unfit to wear a belt of any kind, including the one that holds up your pants! [takes off SpongeBob's belt which causes his pants to fall down]
Sandy: Don't be disappointed, SpongeBob. A belt isn't the most important thing in karate.
SpongeBob: Easy for you to say, Sandy. Your pants aren't down right around your ankles.
Fuzzy Acorns: [takes Sandy's black belt] And I'm revoking your black belt!
Sandy: Hey! You can't do that!
Fuzzy Acorns: Oh, yes I can! For wasting my time bringing me this sorry, excuse for a student! Stick to something you're good at, son.
SpongeBob: Yes Sensei...[walks off sadly]
Sandy: That was pretty low-down, Fuzzy. The way you humiliated my friend.
Fuzzy Acorns: The Sponge-One will never earn his belt.
Sandy: I know SpongeBob will impress you if you give him one more chance!
Fuzzy Acorns: Silence! No more chances! Sensei never gives two chances! If you really want to impress me, show me where I can get a decent meal around here. Lunch time approaches.
Sandy: That's it! I'll take him to the Krusty Krab and then he might just find himself impressed by a certain sandwich maker!
Fuzzy Acorns: Who're you talking to?
[bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob! What's wrong with you!? Get grilling!
SpongeBob: Squidward I...I failed my karate exam...
Squidward: [sighs] Which is why I keep telling you: Never try anything new, ever! Stick to what you're good at! And stick to it soon!
SpongeBob: Stick to what I'm good at? Hey, Squidward's right! [quickly and easily makes Krabby Patties together. Sandy and Fuzzy Acorns are seen at a table]
Sandy: You sure you don't need an air helmet?
Fuzzy Acorns: This won't take long. Fuzzy has trained himself to go hours without air. [SpongeBob is seen jumping through the air throwing Krabby Patties to customers]
Sandy: How about them moves?
Fuzzy Acorns: Pretty okay...for a fry cook!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Twenty more orders here!
SpongeBob: Twenty! Got it Squidward! [flings more Krabby Patties to customers then jumps back into the kitchen]
Sandy: Well, that took some agility!
Fuzzy Acorns: Simple parlor tricks! [SpongeBob then kicks a Krabby Patty toward Frank] Yah, a Kung-Fu charlatan! [SpongeBob spins around and delivers Krabby Patties to Sandy and Fuzzy Acorns]
Sandy: Now you're convinced!
Fuzzy Acorns: I've seen better!
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob! I like my patty in twelfths, please!
SpongeBob: Okay! [spins the Krabby Patty around and perfectly chops it into twelve equal pieces.]There you go, Sandy!
Fuzzy Acorns: Huh!? Maybe "squishy boy" is more skilled than I first thought!
Sandy: Told ya!
Fuzzy Acorns: Not so fast, Squirrel Cheeks! The only way to truly know is to test him myself! [puts on a headband and jumps toward SpongeBob but SpongeBob walks away and Fuzzy Acorns goes through a table]
Harold: Hey, waiter! An empty plate!?
SpongeBob: [Fuzzy Acorns screams and charges at SpongeBob but SpongeBob, not knowing, chops him in the face] Oh! I forgot the fries! [heads into the kitchen]
Fuzzy Acorns: [follows SpongeBob into the kitchen] Now, I see you're a skilled opponent! With a cold-blooded heart of a warrior!
SpongeBob: [holding a Krabby Patty while also not paying attention to Fuzzy Acorns] Sigh...You little Krabby Patties are so cute! Hmm...something's not right here. [sniffs the Krabby Patty] It's the onions! They've gone bad! [throws all the onions away with most of them hitting Fuzzy Acorns]
Fuzzy Acorns: He's on the offensive! [falls into a barrel of trash] Time for you to end this! [walks on the ceiling and falls onto SpongeBob but gets attacked while SpongeBob was cutting up more onions]
Sandy: That's showing him, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob dashes out as Fuzzy Acorns lands on the grill] You gonna give him a belt Fuzzy? Or have you not had enough yet?
Fuzzy Acorns: You brought me to the dance, but the universe is cutting in!
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: [grilling Krabby Patties] Okay, looking good!
Fuzzy Acorns: Sponge-Man! [charges at SpongeBob] Smell the vibrations! [lands onto SpongeBob's body, but gets tossed away]
SpongeBob: Make the fires! I almost forgot! [Fuzzy Acorns lands in a barrel of pickles]
Squidward: More Patties!
SpongeBob: Grilling them now! [puts more Patties on the grill and runs back to Harold and Debbie] Your fries, sir! [Fuzzy Acorns charges at SpongeBob once again and SpongeBob hands Frankie Billy fries] And your fries, sir! Ketchup? [drops the ketchup bottle] Oops! [bends down to pick it up and Fuzzy Acorns misses overhead and crashes] Got it! Gasp! Fuzzy!
Sandy: Oh no!
SpongeBob: Sensei Fuzzy! You okay?
Fuzzy Acorns: I was wrong about you, SpongeBob. You have bested Fuzzy, with your karate greatness! [coughs and takes out a black belt] You are now a karate master!
SpongeBob: For me? Thanks, Fuzzy! Fuzzy? You look terrible! [shows a close up of Fuzzy's horrific  face and he begins to behave strangely] Sandy, what's wrong with Fuzzy?
Sandy: I know what he needs! He just needs this! [puts an air helmet on Fuzzy's head]
Fuzzy Acorns: No more talk, only do! Sandy my dear, for holding your own against the sponge, you have truly proven yourself worthy of the Blacker Belt! [Sandy takes the blacker belt from him and she puts it around her suit]
Sandy and SpongeBob: Thanks, Fuzzy! [watches as Fuzzy's pants fall down]
Fuzzy Acorns: Why must the universe confound me so!? [he, SpongeBob, Sandy, and the rest of the customers all share a laugh]
Patrick: [walks down the street wearing a tie, green jeans, a hat and carrying a briefcase. He stops and rips off his tie] Uhh. Such a tired day at the office. [looks at his watch] Boy, am I famished. I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom. [smell comes and Patrick's stomach morphs into a nose shape] From where has this glorious scent come?
Squidward: [comes to Patrick] Hark, the odor you seek is before you.
Mr. Krabs: [jumps out from Krusty Krab's doors wearing a leotard] At the Krusty Krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook. [raises hand to SpongeBob who comes out sky sliding on rainbow holding a spatula] And served with a smile by our friendly waiter. [Squidward arrives on a dolphin with a platter of Krabby Patties and gives the plate to Patrick, Patrick pours the Krabby Patties into his mouth, then it reveals that it was all a storyboard planned by SpongeBob for a commercial]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?
SpongeBob: Oh, cause you're the mascot.
Mr. Krabs: Nah, I don't think so! [he tears off the storyboard pictures on the wall as SpongeBob looks in horror, some pieces of the shreds flies into SpongeBob's face and he blows it off him] We need a gimmic that's nothing short of a masterpiece.
SpongeBob: Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesdays! [Mr. Krabs stops walking and SpongeBob bumps into him. Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob out of the kitchen. SpongeBob looks depressed and sighs louder and louder and louder which irritates Squidward.]
Squidward: Oh, for dolphins sakes! Do tell what's troubling you so!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.
Squidward: Shocking.
SpongeBob: I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimic.
Squidward: Sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap.
SpongeBob: Great idea, Squidward! [zooms off]
Squidward: That'll keep him out of my hair. [rattling engine noises are heard and smoke engulfs around Squidward. Squidwards sees SpongeBob wearing a big blue machine of his head saying thinking as SpongeBob thinks really hard for an idea.] Of course, he actually has one. [Squidward leaves his cash register and sees a strange patron squirting ketchup all over the Krabby Patties. He then picks them up and drops them all over the floor] To each, his own.
Fiasco: Mustard!
Squidward: Yes, your freakishness. [he swipes the mustard from Squidward's hand and squirts it all over the platter. Squidward sighs in disgust as mustard splashes onto his face]
Fiasco: [drops the empty mustard condiment as he is finished] Like our own fleeting existence, an untimely end has come upon this Krabby value meal. [he notices something on the platter and scrapes it off before he leaves]
Squidward: Good riddance. [just as Squidward was about to spray the table, he he quickly notices what the patron has done on the platter] What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls. [gasps] Sweet Neptune! Could that have been...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward. [Mr. Krabs takes the platter and tries to throw it away, but Squidward takes it from him] 
Squidward: That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!
Mr. Krabs: Ok, let's not overdo it.
Squidward: No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist! [pulls out the Art Wonk magazine] He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!
Mr. Krabs: [reads the magazine and sees the picture of Fiasco and his art in it] Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker.
Squidward: It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!
SpongeBob: [takes the Fiasco from Squidward] Ohh, what is this?
Squidward: [takes it back from SpongeBob] This is an authentic Fiasco!
Customers: A Fiasco? [gets up from their tables and looks at the Fiasco in amazement] Ooh!
Dave: An original Fiasco, you say?
Gus: He's one of the famous picture-drawing artistes!
Nancy-Suzy Fish: Just look at his audacious use of pickle in this piece.
Jimmy Gus: [stutters] What's your asking price?
Squidward: Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars.
Mr. Krabs: Hold it! [takes the Fiasco]  I'll take a million for it.
Squidward: [takes it back] It's not yours to sell! I found it!
Mr. Krabs: Me plate, me buns, me mustard, [tries to take it from Squidward] me Fiasco.
Squidward: You tried to throw it away! [pulls it back] It's mine!
Farfel Bainbridge: Let's not be hasty. It belongs to…neither of you. Farfel Bainbridge: Curator of the Bikini Bottom Art Museum. We curators have a way of sniffing these things out. [takes the Fiasco from Squidward and examines it. He sniffs it for a little bit] [gasps] It's authentic! Aahh! Which makes this a national treasure! [everyone cheers as Farfel places the Fiasco back on the table and puts a glass lid around it] And for preservation, it must be hermetically sealed! [blows his whistle] And guarded by Bikini Bottom's finest! [three police men rip off their costumes, revealing themselves]
Officer John: Ready for duty, sir!
Mr. Krabs: Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property.
Farfel Bainbridge: Well, technically, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people of Bikini Bottom. Unfortunately, they'll have to set foot in this grease-trap to get a look at this great piece of art.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic. [goes to a scene where the Krusty Krab has a really long line waiting to see the Fiasco] Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece! [Evelyn and Frankie look at the Fiasco] Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!
Frankie Billy: Two Krabby Patties, please.
Mr. Krabs: Each!
Plankton: [while all the customers are lined up, Plankton sneaks up behind a small rock outside of the Chum Bucket] So, what have you got for me today, huh? [looks through his telescope] No Krabby Patty in sight. [notices the customers looking at the Fiasco] What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to reverse engineer a whole Krabby Patty! [gets down and paddles to the Krusty Krab with a tiny bag on a unicycle] Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier.
Mr. Krabs: [As Mr. Krabs counts his money and sniffs some of them from his valuable success, he hears a loud scream in the dining room] I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying! [opens his office door and sees Plankton making a getaway with the Fiasco in his bag] Stop that thief!
Plankton: Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!
Mr. Krabs: Stop thief! [pushes the alarm button and emergency bell rings and alarm blares; Cut to the police car driving after Plankton]
Plankton: Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free! [Just then, he hears the sirens of the police cars. As he turns around, he notices several more police cars following him at high pursuit.]
Officer John: Stop thief!
Plankton: Ahh! [paddles faster] What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage! [the police chases Plankton into the streets of Bikini Bottom and passes by the Movie Palace. Plankton manages to take refuge in the movie theater] What's going on?
Female movie character: How long do you think we'll be here?
Male movie character: I don't know. But my stomach feels all tingly.
Female movie character: Mine does too. [the movie characters slowly attempt to kiss, until Officer Rob bursts through the screen]
Officer Rob: Hey you! Yeah, you in the chair!
Officer John: Don't move! [the cops burst out of the screen and chases Plankton out of the movie theater and into the supermarket]
Plankton: [as the cops search all over the market, Plankton hides in a batch of flowers but his eyes gets all watery due to the pollen] Achoo! [the cops turn around and sees where Plankton is hiding] Blasted pollen allergies! [Plankton notices that the cops are looking at him and quickly runs out of the market as the cops chase him from behind. He somehow manages to take refuge in a floating satellite in outer space, thinking that he is safe.] Ahh, I should be safe in space. [he hears the hatch door open and sees that the cops are still after him only in spacesuits this time]
Officer John: Stop thief!
Plankton: You gotta be kidding me! [exits out of the satellite as the cops pursue from behind. Sooner or later, Plankton becomes exhausted from being chased around by the cops. He then stumbles upon Patrick's rock] Hello? Hello? [knocks] Open up! [continues knocking] Open up!
Patrick: [opens his rock as he is in his purple robe] Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning! [slams his rock]
Plankton: Wait, what? [looks around and sees SpongeBob's house and bursts in the front door with a wooden spoon in his hand] Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'! [SpongeBob raises his hands in the air] Ok you two, against the wall! [SpongeBob and Gary get off of the chair and sofa and walk up towards the wall] That's it. Nice and slow. [Plankton walks into the house and places the bag on the table revealing the Fiasco he has stolen to SpongeBob. Plankton jumps up onto SpongeBob's chair] You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!
SpongeBob: I-I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.
Plankton: Really?
SpongeBob: So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.
Plankton: Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for.
SpongeBob: Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.
Plankton: You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?
SpongeBob: No, you need to turn yourself in.
Plankton: Turn myself-What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Plankton: Me, you imbecile!
SpongeBob: What?
Plankton: Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah.
SpongeBob: Really?
Plankton: And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Now you've gone too far!
Plankton: No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!
SpongeBob: I can't believe you're calling me that!
Plankton: Believe it, Man Boy!
Patrick: [comes in and appears to be eating something] Hey! What did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you eating?
Patrick: The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table. [an empty plate is shown as it reveals that Patrick is eating the Fiasco that Plankton stole. SpongeBob and Plankton gasp in horror as Patrick swallows the Fiasco and burps] Not bad.
SpongeBob: Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!
Plankton: Ohh, he's an accomplice too!
Squidward: [bursts through the front door with the cops behind him] Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep.
Officer John: Well, well, well. If it isn't the art thief himself. Drop the spoon. [Plankton throws the spoon away after realizing he has no place to run anymore] You're all under arrest until we figure this out. [puts handcuffs on Squidward's wrists]
Squidward: But what do you mean "all"? [stammering] I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep! [cuts to the Bikini Bottom Police Station]
Officer John: [locks Plankton away in jail as SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, and Mr. Krabs stand there and watch] Thanks for clearing this whole mess up, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finito! [begins to cry]
SpongeBob: [thinks for a second and comes up with an idea, snaps his fingers] Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution. [cuts to the Krusty Krab with a really long line]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo.
SpongeBob: My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.
Patrick: [stands behind the x-ray and presents the Fiasco he accidentally ate to the customers, which amazes them. As he is showing it to them, he giggles for a little bit] X-rays tickle.
Fiasco: Such artistic genius! [throws his paintings on the floor and smashes them to bits] I'll never paint again!
Squidward: [reveals that he is still behind bars at the Bikini Bottom Police Station] Hey, don't I get a phone call?
SpongeBob: ♪Mop, mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping mopping!♪
Squidward: SpongeBob! [Frank comes in and brings him a dollar] Why don't you mop your way over the kitchen. [points at Frank] We need another Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Sure thing. [SpongeBob walks to make a Krabby Patty. He puts a patty in a half made Krabby Patty and he puts too much mustard on it. Mr. Krabs opens the hot shelter and smells he that he put on too much mustard]
Mr. Krabs: What's that?
SpongeBob: [puts on the last bun] Perfection. [Mr. Krabs walks to see SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: I don't think so. [grabs the Krabby Patty and sees too much mustard. Mr. Krabs gets angry at SpongeBob] You used too much mustard!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs I...
Mr. Krabs: You obviously you didn't use your hydraulic mustard gauge. [Mr. Krabs uses a spoon and scoops some mustard. The spoon reads 101%. Mr Krabs gasps in shock] You think mustard grows from seeds? [throws the spoon and Krabby Patty away] Oh, at this rate, I'll be broke in [types the list] 411 years!
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: Your skills are rusty, you're not your usual sharp self! Did you have breakfast this morning?
SpongeBob: Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a Neptune muffin.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... well what about sleep, young man. Did you get enough sleep?
SpongeBob: I did go to bed 2 minutes later than usual.
Mr. Krabs: [looks at SpongeBob] That's it! [pokes SpongeBob's body] You're an insomniac!
SpongeBob: An insomni-wha?
Mr. Krabs: You're a person who can't sleep and if you can't get enough sleep, your mind starts to go! [SpongeBob is surprised] Here. [Gives SpongeBob the spatula and pushes him to the grill] Come on, now, cook! [SpongeBob starts to flip patties. He pauses and glances at Mr. Krabs before flipping the patty. Mr. Krabs stops him] Ha! Ha ha! I knew it! You lifted a patty from one side, instead of straight up! What are you trying to do, sabotage me?! [takes the spatula and shoves him outside] Now you go home and get some rest!
SpongeBob: Oh, but sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Miss work? If you keep making mistakes like that, boyo, there will be no Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: No Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: That's right! [points at the road] Now, get!
SpongeBob: [walks down the road] Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Come back tomorrow after a good night's sleep! [Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple]
SpongeBob: I just don't get it Gary, I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?
Gary: [Chews his snail food]
SpongeBob: Well I am not going to allow a mistake like today's to happen again. I am going straight to bed! [Cut to SpongeBob's bed.
SpongeBob: This pillow is hard as a rock! What to do?
Gary: Meow meow meow meow.
SpongeBob: You're right Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep! Now, that should do the trick!
SpongeBob: [Milk pours out of SpongeBob's holes] Boy, it sure is quiet around here. Only 5 hours until I go to work. C'mon SpongeBob, you can do this. 4 hours 59 minutes 50 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 45 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds! [SpongeBob throws the clock away] What if I don't get to sleep at all? [in thoughts] Ohhh, Mr. Krabs was right! [Camera goes on SpongeBob's eyes] I am an insomniac. What am I gonna do? (speaking) I need some help. [SpongeBob runs to Patrick's] Patrick, Patrick, wake up. [SpongeBob pulls Patrick up]
Patrick: Uh huh. [SpongeBob is speaking gibberish] Mmmm, sponge cake. [Chews on SpongeBob's hand]
SpongeBob: Oh, yuck! Never mind that Patrick! I need your help! Desperately! I'm a insomniac! I need to sleep!
Patrick: Say no more buddy, I know just the thing! [Takes a deep breath, blows off the sand, and grabs a book] Get comfy!
SpongeBob: Oh boy! A bedtime story! [Pulls up the sand into a pillow and lays down]
Patrick: Okay. Once upon a time there was a sleepy little boy.
SpongeBob: Ah, yay!
Patrick: The sleepy boy was the sleepiest boy in all the kingdom!
SpongeBob: Mm, sounds like me.
Patrick: One night, he nestled into bed for a long slumber.
SpongeBob: Slumber!
Patrick: And Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king, sprinkled him with mystical sleepy dust.
SpongeBob: Aw, thank you Sir Cecil.
Patrick: He couldn't have been cozier. When, without warning, an excitable sea troll burst through the window. "Wakey wakey sleepy doo!" he bellowed. Then suddenly he was whisked away by eagle-winged mollusks into the night sky!
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? And what kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?
Patrick: It's called The Land of Perpetual Excitement. You know, it's a "get out of bed" story!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep.
Patrick: Oh. [Throws the book on SpongeBob's nose] Right. Oh I know! I'll sing you a lullaby from my childhood! "Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
SpongeBob: Um, Patrick, that's...
Patrick: Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, be active! Get up, be active!
SpongeBob: Patrick, this isn't...
Patrick: Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
SpongeBob: That's a catchy bit...
Patrick: Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
SpongeBob: That's an excellent number, but...
Patrick: Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
SpongeBob: [yelling] Patrick! This isn't helping either!
Patrick: Well, what-what abou- well, I don't know what you want from me. It's not like I have a magic wand to wave. [Gets magic tools] Or do I...
SpongeBob: Oh, barnacles.
Patrick: Hocus, pocus!
SpongeBob: Patrick, get serious please!
Patrick: Abra zeptabra!
SpongeBob: I really appreciate your efforts, but I gotta try something else, buddy. 'Kay?
Patrick: SpongeBob, I see you're serious about this now. I didn't want to do this, but I'm gonna let you in on a little family secret. Old grandma suffered from severe toe barnacles.
SpongeBob: Blech!
Patrick: And she invented the secret elixir for just such an emergency. Drink up.
SpongeBob: Okay... Patrick, How is this gonna-
Patrick: Drink it!
SpongeBob: Hey, That wasn't too bad. What was it?
Patrick: Coffee.
SpongeBob: C-C-C-C-C-Coffee? Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep!
Patrick: Oops..
SpongeBob: Uh oh.. feeling jittery, heart p-p-pounding, teeth grinding... [Legs start to run by themselves] Uh oh. [Starts to fly around and then breaks Patrick's rock] N-no! No stop! We gotta get to sleep. Well, I guess I'll just have to let my legs tire out and catch up with my weary brain.
Sea troll: Wakey Wakey Sleepy Doo!
SpongeBob: Ahh! Sea troll! Huh? Just a shrub. Keep going till you crash SpongeBob.
Warm milk: SpongeBob, Why did you drink me?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry Mr. warm milk, you just tasted so good. [Shakes head] Shoo! That billboard is definitely not talking to you.
Warm Milk: Why SpongeBob, why?
Mustard Krabs: Stop wasting all me mustard, boyo!
[SpongeBob notices a giant Mr. Krabs with mustard spouts for eye stalks and runs]
Mustard Krabs: Me profits! Me profits!
[The mustard gets in SpongeBob's way and he backs up and knocks over mustard barrels]
Squidwards: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Mr. Krabs is going to be upset! Ha, ha, ha, ha! [Drown SpongeBob in the mustard. A seagull takes SpongeBob and takes him to a giant Patrick]
Patrick: Sponge cake!
[SpongeBob gets eaten by Patrick and breaks a bed when he lands]
SpongeBob: What's this? Another vision? [sees what looks like the sun starting to rise] Oh why, why? Please, please, please let me sleep for just 5 minutes!
Sir Cecil: Do not despair, my child.
SpongeBob: Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king!?
Sir Cecil: Just close your eyes and slumber. With some magic dust! [Picks up the dust and tosses it on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hm.. it's getting all sleepish around here. [Goes back into reality] Oh, thank you Sir Cecil. Hmm? Hey, looks like I finally got some shut-eye. Now to prepare for work. [Puts hat in a hole] Perfect. [Leaves] Bye, Gary. [Goes to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Boyo...? [Snaps his claw. SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hu-ee?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Huh? Y-Yes... SpongeBob reporting for sleepy and tired.
Mr. Krabs: Ew! You're stinking like Davy Jones' locker! You sure you didn't forget something, boy?
SpongeBob: Forget..? Oh, right, right, Mr. Krabs. How could I be so forgetful?
Mr. Krabs: Heh, that's my boy. [Sees SpongeBob] What the barnacles?!
[SpongeBob washes his hands with the mustard dispenser]
SpongeBob: Employees must wash their hands before cooking. [He smears mustard on his face] Oh, that's nice...
Mr. Krabs: That ain't the sink, kiddo! [SpongeBob gets into the mustard barrel]
SpongeBob: I know I know, I just need a quiet place... to nap.
Mr. Krabs: Me mustard! [Pulls SpongeBob out of the barrel] You didn't heed my words, did ya? You couldn't be bothered to get some shut eye, could ya?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry Mr. Krabs! I tried, I really tried! But my insomnia got the best of me! [SpongeBob starts to cry tears of mustard]
Mr. Krabs: Now he's crying away me mustard. That's enough boy! Me profits! [Mr. Krabs is surprised] Huh? Your crying the perfect amount! Hold it boyo, you're a natural born mustard dispenser!
SpongeBob: Is that a good thing? 
Mr. Krabs: Dow, uh, nuh, Oh no, no boy. It's- It's terrible.
[SpongeBob cries again]
Mr. Krabs: Just terrible!
Squidward: Best day at work ever!
SpongeBob: [Sings as he walks through the city] Going to work, going to work, I'm going to work! I'm going to work, I'm going to work [spins arms around] I'm going to work! [Twirls] I'm going to work. I'm going to work, going to work, go-going to work. I'm crossing the street! [does so] Crossing the street! I'm crossing the street! Crossing the... [Stops] Wha...? [Hears Plankton crying] I'd recognize that sound anywhere! It's the sound of horrible, croaking sobbing! [Runs over to dark alley]
Plankton: [Tearfully] Oh, Neptune! Why, oh why?!
SpongeBob: Plankton?
Plankton: No, please!  I told you I'd get the money! Please, I- [Stops suddenly and realizes SpongeBob is standing right behind him.] Oh, it's you.
SpongeBob: Plankton, what's got you so upset? I can hear you from three blocks away!
Plankton: Oh, that. It's this doomsday device I invented. [Holds up small device] It just doesn't do what it's supposed to do! 
SpongeBob: Doomsday device? What's it supposed to do?
Plankton: Well, it's supposed to upset the Earth's axis. Causing a chain reaction with typhoons, earthquakes, etc.
SpongeBob: So, what does it do instead?
Plankton: It just sparks and falls apart.
SpongeBob: Sparks and falls apart?
Plankton: You don't believe me?
SpongeBob: [Frantically] N-no!  I believe you! I uh... [Plankton presses button on his device, causing it to spark and smoke and eventually fall apart.] ...believe you.
Plankton: Oh, what's the use?!  Everyday the same old thing. Life is an endless succession of failures and disappointments.
SpongeBob: Well, look on the bright side, Plankton. If all your hopes and dreams finally came true, then you wouldn't have anything left to look forward to.
Plankton: Well, I didn't think I could feel any worse, but at least I know now that anything is possible.
SpongeBob: Plankton, wait! [Holds out arms to stop him]Wait! [Long pause]Wait!
Plankton: I'm waiting!
SpongeBob: Maybe what you need is to join a club or something. Meet new people. You know, make some friends.
Plankton: Hmmm. Yes. Yes. Are you suggesting I form an evil alliance?
SpongeBob: Um, something like that.
Plankton: That is an excellent idea! But where would someone like me find new friends?
SpongeBob: Well, usually when I'm trying to find something, I just look it up in the phone book. [Holds up yellow phone book. Then he gives it to Plankton]
Plankton: [Struggles with phone book in his hands] [Sarcastically] Oh, great. Thanks. [Throws book on the ground and climbs on it.] Let's see here. Aha!  Here we go. [Reads off of phone book] Evil villain for hire. Call Man Ray. No job too diabolical.
SpongeBob: Man Ray? But he's one of Bikini Bottom's most notorious super villains! Arch nemesis of fame television super heroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [Gets confused] He's in the phone book? [Plankton laughs] Plankton, you were looking under Fiends not Friends.
Plankton: Oh, I know, SpongeBob. I know. [Tries to hold in his laughter, but he can't and starts laughing again. SpongeBob laughs with him. He then stops and gets confused. Bubble transition to Man Ray in the Bargain Mart putting stuff into vending machines.] Man Ray! We meet at long last! And who would have thought to find here you here, working a part-time job restocking vending machines? That's very clever, Man Ray. Very clever. And now let us join in evil alliance!
SpongeBob: A little more sand. Pat, Pat, Pat. Pat, Pat, Patrick! Check it out. An exact replica of the Krusty Krab. One sandy patty. Extra grit.
Patrick: [gulps] A bit dry and flavorless. I'll take two dozen.
Fred: Hey, everyone! The Drastic Radicals are tearing it up on Sand Mountain! 
[Everyone runs to Sand Mountain.]
SpongeBob: Let's check it out!
Patrick: Um, could you give me a hand?
SpongeBob: Sure thing, buddy. [Patrick whistles and Patrick's body comes and places his head on his body]
[about Sand Mountain excited chatter]
Patrick: I can't see anything.
SpongeBob: Allow me.
[heard engine revs, crowd gasps]
Johnny Krill: Yeahhh! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Patrick: Whoa!
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Patrick: Wow!
SpongeBob: Wow!
Patrick: Wow!
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Patrick: Whoa!
[bugle call]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Look out!
[Not Dead Ted laughs]
SpongeBob: Someone help that little old lady!
Grand Maul Granny: Help yourselves, himrods!
[explosion, screaming together, engine revs]
Narrator: Johnny Krill! Not Dead Ted! [Grand Moul Granny laughs] Grand Moul Granny! [explosion] Drastic... Radicals! [explosion] The drasticals!
Patrick: Did you see that?
SpongeBob and Patrick: What was that?
British Gentleman: Why, those are the Dwastic Wadicals, the number one practitioners of extweme spowts. [sips tea]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Extreme what?
British Gentleman: Extweme spowts.
Patrick: Extreme spots? Well, that's no fair. You're already covers in extreme spots. Ooh. Hold on a second. [hive buzzing, Patrick screaming, electricity crackling] Okay, let's do meet our new heroes.
[The Drasticals laughing]
SpongeBob: We want to join your extreme spots team, as you can see, we're also covered head to toe in the most extreme of spots.
[Drasticals laugh]
Johnny: It's extreme sports, not spots. So you wanna be a Drastical. Let's see what you got, little dude.
SpongeBob: No problemo. I guess you just hop up like this... [revs engines, motorcycle drives off with his hands] Hey! Come back! [SpongeBob chases after it, motorcycle goes faster] Heeeeyyy! [Runs the other way, motorcycle picks him up and he screams as he goes through sand dunes. Motorcycle stops, SpongeBob faints]
Granny: [Chuckling, to Patrick] You're turn, fat boy!
Patrick: Hey! How'd we get up here? [Patrick is pushed off cliff, hits several rocks then falls off mountain]
Johnny: Our sports are too extreme for you dudes. Maybe we should start you two on something easier. What games do you dudes like to play?
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know. How 'bout a little something called Jump rope?
Johnny: Jumprope, eh? Demonstrate.
SpongeBob: Ready Patrick? On your mark, get set, jump rope!
Patrick: Extreme! [starts jumping] Hey, who's holding the other end?
SpongeBob: I am of course. [Pan to the right] Hi Patrick!
Patrick: D'uh. [blows harmonica, starts singing] My best friend is SpongeBob, he has a square head, I try on his clothes while he's asleep in bed.
SpongeBob: Yeah! What?
Patrick: That's weird, my face is leaking.
SpongeBob: You're face isn't leaking. You're just sweating from all the exercise.
Patrick: Exercise?! [stops] Eww, I didn't sign up for this! [faints]
SpongeBob: Extreme!
Johnny: Dude that was not extreme. Let the Drasticals show you how it's done. Grab it Granny [throws one end of jump rope, Granny bites end of rope, Ted makes a somersault and lands on rope with his tongue, jumps back into the air]
Ted: Drasticals! Whoo! Yeah! [Lands and jumps over rope to the point where he steams up]
Johnny: Kick it up a notch!
[Ted sets aflame and shoots into the air]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooooh.
Ted: Yeah! [plane hits him, he falls face first into ground and burns to a crisp]
Johnny: Yeah! See, extreme sports should be explosive! Boom!
SpongeBob: Explosive, huh? I know just the thing! [dips bubble wand and blows bubble. Bubble pops] Boom! [SpongeBob and Patrick make several explosion sounds] Impressed?
Drasticals: No.
Johnny: Look dudes, to be extreme you gotta go bigger. Show 'em Drasticals! [Granny climbs huge bottle of bubble soap, dips huge wand and puts it in front of a ramp] Watch this! [Rides motorcycle into bubble, speeds into town and knocks over a building. Bubble pops and he gets crushed] Extreme. [Tunnels back, hops out of the ground] Now that's how you do extreme! You understand?
SpongeBob: I think I do. Is fighting extreme?
Johnny: Fighting is totally extreme.
[Scene opens in wrestling ring.]
Patrick: I want a clean fight. I don't wanna see any trash laying around. [Rings his head instead of bell. SpongeBob tries to punch a pillow, spins to the edge, launched back into pillow which land on his head] Oohh...We give up! Fling [Waves towel and throws at SpongeBob] That was close.
Johnny: Not so fast, that's not fighting. Stand aside [Stomps SpongeBob and Patrick out of ring] I'll show you how it's done! [Slams into pillow, puts into washing machine, sets it on wash]
SpongeBob: Noo! It's dry-clean only!
[Johnny smashes machine open, punches pillow out of ring]
Pillow: Avenge me.
SpongeBob: Brutal.
Mattress: Charlie! [Jumps into ring and smashes Johnny, then does it again 6 times more]
Patrick: Even more brutal!
Johnny: Now that was extreme, dudes. You think you're starting to get it?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh yeah.
Johnny: So what else you got?
SpongeBob: Well there is one sport that Patrick's an expert at.
Patrick: Dumpster diving!
[Patrick pushes dumpster, climbs it, and jumps in. SpongeBob cheers. Patrick sinks in and pops out, coughing up some trash.]
Johnny: That's not extreme.
Patrick: [Spits out old toothbrush] How revolting. [Brushes teeth with it]
Johnny: Okay, that's kinda extreme. Not bad, but the Drasticals will show you how it's done. [Ted brings in a ladder with diving board and Granny on top. Ladder is set higher]
Granny: Okay artificial hip, don't fail me now. [Jumps into dumpster and chuckles. Johnny dumps her and trash into a garbage truck and crushes them with a compactor. Trash comes out a square shape and Granny pops out] Extreme!
Patrick: That is one tough elderly person.
Johnny: Dude, that was awesome! What other crazy sports do you dudes play?
SpongeBob: Well, there is a very extremely extreme sport we play if you're up to it.
[At Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob and Patrick chase after jellyfish]
Patrick: Hey, where are the Drasticals? [They feel ground shaking] Here they come!
[Johnny catches jellyfish on motorcycle, Ted in the air, and Granny riding them like a tidal wave]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Patrick: Amazing!
Johnny: Jellyfishing, yeah...[Jellyfish flies into his mouth and stings him, Ted flies into huge jellyfish and burns, thrown into Johnny and Granny and they get caught in an explosion]
Johnny: [Covered in stings] Dudes, now we get it! These spots are way extreme!
Ted: And itchy!
British Gentleman: As you can see, extweme spowts are the direct bi-product of the most extweme spowts.
Patrick: Who is that guy?
Squidward: [At register] Ah, yes, just how I like it... nice and empty. [looks around at the empty restaurant]
Old Man Jenkins: [Sitting at a table] Hey, I'm still here. [Waves]
Squidward: Oh, yes, sirree—nice and empty. [Looks around then sits down at the register. Presses a button revealing a slot with a pillow. Pulls down a picture of an island and turns on a fan. Drinks a drink and is relaxed]
Jimmy: Do you work here? [looking over register]
Squidward: [Spits his drink. Sighs] Welcome to the Krusty-- Wha-What the! [Sees the large line of people and gasps] Well, there goes my nap. Multiple orders up! Sponge... Bob! SpongeBob! Where are you?! You need to get out here and make those Krabby Patties. [Looking for SpongeBob in the kitchen. SpongeBob starts laughing from inside a barrel. Squidward looks through the barrel hole. SpongeBob is writing in a book. Squidward grumbles and sticks a megaphone into the hole] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes out of the megaphone like liquid] Get it together, SpongeBob. The dining room is full of ravenous customers. [Customers making monkey noises, chewing on things, and swinging from ropes]
SpongeBob: [In liquid form, goes to the storage freezer and comes back out with a stack of patties] I got it. [Spins like a tornado throwing the patties onto the grill. Presses button on spatula twice that makes it fold out to have triple length. Flips three patties and whistles]
Squidward: Hmm, what was that imbecile doing in there? [Looking at the barrel. Pulls out book] An old book?
SpongeBob: [Looks back scared] Nothing.
[Takes book from Squidward and places it between the fryers]
Squidward: What's going on here?
[SpongeBob gets all the patties into a stack and puts ingredients inside of himself. Jumps out to the dining area where he jumps onto the ceiling and shoots out Krabby Patties to the customers]
Customers: Thank you! [Waving at SpongeBob. They take bites and give thumbs up to each other. SpongeBob continues to shoot out Krabby Patties. Customers clap once again]
Old Man Jenkins: Excuse me. I wanted pickles on mine. [SpongeBob taps his head twice, shooting pickles onto Krabby Patty]
[Squidward looks out from the kitchen to the main area of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Hmmm. [Picks up book from between the fryers] If SpongeBrain is keeping the book away from me, then I have no choice but to read it. [SpongeBob walks into kitchen]
SpongeBob: I'll take that, thank you. [Takes book]
[SpongeBob is sitting on top of a barrel writing in the diary]
Squidward: [Looking through the kitchen window with his nose hanging over] There he goes again, scribbling away in that little book. [Turns back around] I must admit, my curiosity is peaked... I guess I'm "peaked" to "peek" at that book. [Laughs as a rimshot is heard. Sighs] Oh, puns. [Wipes away tears from laughing]
Old Man Jenkins: [Sitting at a table] Ha.
Squidward: [Holding brown bag] Hey, SpongeBob, you need to make a delivery.
SpongeBob: [Closes diary, sets it down, and turns towards Squidward] Okie-dokie!
Squidward: The address is on the bag.
SpongeBob: I got it. [Walks out of kitchen]
Squidward: [Whistles and walks to the diary. Picks up the diary and gasps] It's a diary! Oh-ho-ho. This is gonna be good. Huh? Drat, it's locked. [Tries to pry lock open] Hmm. I need a hairpin. [Mr. Krabs is in his office writing on paper. Squidward reaches behind him and pulls out a hairpin. Mr. Krabs' hair puffs out into an afro. Squidward unlocks the lock with the pin, opens the diary, watching it glow and a heavenly choir singing] And now... the diary of a moron. [Reading diary]
SpongeBob: "Dear diary, what an amazing day I've..." [Fades into SpongeBob narrating he story] ...day I've had. [Phone ringing] This morning I was greeted by my nearest and dearest neighbor, Squidward. [Answers phone] He had some very important news he was just bursting to share. [Phone growls at SpongeBob. Walks to Squidward's house] He had decided that today would be the perfect day to deliver his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet. [Knocks on the door. Squidward answers and holds Gary angrily. Gary is chewing. Squidward shoves Gary to SpongeBob] Specifically, what not to feed them. [Squidward holds up a record album that reads "Sole Jazz" and throws it at SpongeBob] The list was very thorough. [Squidward holds up a torn shirt on hanger, then a picture of his mother with a bite taken out of it] Needless to say, this is all very enlightening. [Squidward throws picture on ground and jumps on it] It warms my heart to know that Squidward thinks we're close enough to use the harshest words in his critique-- [Squidward yelling in SpongeBob's face] Horrible words that should never be used around strangers, who may now know how well-intentioned those words are. [Squidward points and pokes SpongeBob angrily] Knowing I have a tendency to dawdle, Gary cut our conversation short. [Gary bites Squidward's hand. Squidward punts SpongeBob] And I was hurried along to work, where I arrived only a hour and a half early for what may be my favorite day of the year, [SpongeBob lands at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs unlocks the front door] cleaning day! [SpongeBob mopping, Mr. Krabs reading the paper] Together, Mr. Krabs and I scrubbed every inch of the Krusty Krab, [SpongeBob scrubbing floor] and finally, with a little elbow grease, we were able to get into even the tightest spots. [Mr. Krabs using SpongeBob as chimney sweep] Ah yes, cleaning day. [Narration ends]
Squidward: Great Neptune, I had no idea. The depth of his delusion is awe inspiring.
SpongeBob: [Knocks on door] Well, I don't know. Something about this delivery address doesn't seem right. [SpongeBob is at a dumpster. Gasps] Wait a minute. Squidward! He must have been the victim of a prank phone call. Poor Squidward. He can be so gullible. [SpongeBob sets the delivery in the dumpster]
Patrick: [Comes up from inside the dumpster] Oh, boy! [Looks in bag] A ketchup packet! That'll go great on this old diaper. [Holds up ketchup and diaper]
SpongeBob: [Back at the Krusty Krab. Chuckles] Oh, Squidward! You are gonna laugh when you hear what I've... been. [Squidward crouches down to hide] Squidward? Where are you? Could have sworn I just saw him.
Squidward: [nervously sweating] SpongeBob, uh, one of the customers dropped his watch in a toilet, and I need you to fish it out. [Holds up plunger and hanger]
SpongeBob: [Takes hanger and plunger] Duty calls.
[Squidward takes diary out from inside his hat. Opens it, turns the page, and laughs. His laugh turns into a cough as he sees a large customer at the register]
Customer #2: You laughing at me?
Squidward: What? Oh, no. No, no, no. I was just reading what SpongeBob wrote in his diary. It's hilarious.
Customer #2: Reading somebody else's diary—that's terrible! Tell me more!
Squidward: It says here, when SpongeBob sees plaid, he has the uncontrollable urge to cluck like a chicken. [Both laugh]
Mr. Krabs: [Now at the register] Did somebody say plaid? Why I'm a plaid enthusiast. [Wearing kilt] I just got me new kilt today.
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob. Can you come here, please?
SpongeBob: [Walks out of the restroom with  a tire, umbrella, guitar, anchor, and Old Man Jenkins] I couldn't find that watch anywhere. All I found was this stuff--
Old Man Jenkins: I fell in.
SpongeBob: And that guy.
Squidward: What do you think of Mr. Krabs' new plaid kilt?
SpongeBob: P-p-p-p-plaid? [SpongeBob's face doubles with 2 mouths. He throws everything out of his hands]
Old Man Jenkins: Hey! [SpongeBob starts clucking like a chicken and crows like a rooster]
Mr. Krabs: Well, you don't have to be nasty about it!
[Squidward and Customer #2 laugh. SpongeBob is still clucking]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob slaps himself] Avert your eyes, SquarePants. [Covers eyes] I have to take my break! [Runs through the kitchen out the back. Pulls out bubble soap and blows bubbles. Sighs]
Squidward: [Reading to customers] Listen to this — SpongeBob has named his spatula "Fifi."
[Customers all laugh]
Henry-Bart: He named his spatula "Fifi."
Nat: He named his spatula "Fifi." [Telling customers behind him. Customers laugh] What kind of name is Fifi?
Patrick: [Laughing loudly] Who ever heard of naming a spatula Fifi? It's a girl's name! Right, Frank? [Holds up his own spatula]
SpongeBob: [Walks out of the kitchen holding spatula] I'm back from my break. Any orders, Squidward?
Patrick: Yeah, cook me up a Krabby Patty... with good old Fifi.
SpongeBob: [Gasps] Oh, sure thing. [Runs to kitchen] Fifi, how did Patrick know your name? Have you been talking?
Squidward: Oh, oh, this is the best one yet. Get this: "If I hear the Bikini Bottom Municipal Anthem, I can't help but take off all my clothes and dance around in my underwear!" [Everyone laughs] Quiet, quiet, quiet. Watch this. [Pulls out radio and plays the anthem] [SpongeBob calmly throws spatula and takes off clothes wearing only his underwear. He dances around. Everyone laughs and the music stops. SpongeBob looks over at Squidward]
SpongeBob: My... Diary! Squidward! How could you?! [Cries and runs into the dining area with everyone laughing at him. Runs into Mr. Krabs, clucks like a chicken again, continues crying, and runs out the door]
Nat: That was that little dude's diary? [Door slams]
Customers: [Overlapping murmuring] That is not okay. That was uncool.
Mr. Krabs: That's low, Squidward... even for you. You'd better apologize.
Squidward: [Scoffs] He'll get over it.
[SpongeBob is crying outside of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is scatting and humming. He pulls out an umbrella as he walks by SpongeBob crying]
Newspaper Boy: Extra, extra, read all about it! Jerk reads the diary, local fry cook devastated. [Holding up newspaper]
Squidward: Oh, boy, let me see one of those papers. Uh-huh, mm-hm. [Cover of paper shows a sad photo of SpongeBob. Squidward laughs and tosses the paper on the ground. Citizens stare at him] Taxi! [Waving, a taxi car with the model of the boat screeches its tires, approaching him]
Driver: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it, pal. You're that diary reader.
Squidward: Yes, I am. [Driving away in an angry attitude after hearing tires squeal, Squidward coughs in the exhaust. Then he continues walking]
Abigail-Marge: Diary thief!
Sandals: Jerk!
John: Secret stealer!
Sadie: Billy, stay away from that mean, old diary reader.
Squidward: Morons. [At his front door]
Quincy: Squidward Tentacles, by reading another person's diary, you have violated the terms of your loan. [Holds up loan papers] We are repossessing your house.
Squidward: [coughs] What?
Quincy: Take it away, boys! [Squidward’s house is lifted away with a crane. Thunder crashes and it starts to rain. Squidward puts up his umbrella and gets hit by lightning]
Squidward: Ow! [Squidward now laying on a bench with newspapers over his body. The papers blow away]
Officer Nancy: [Taps Squidward on the head with a club with her partner, Officer John] Hey, you can't sleep here, fella. [Horn honks] Wait a second, you're that diary reader! I had a diary once. My brother read it! I had a brother once! Come on, fella! We have a special place for people like you!
[Squidward is locked in a pillory]
Patrick: Diary reader! [He throws a tomato at Squidward]
Squidward: What!? You read it, too!
Patrick: Oh, sure, blame everyone but yourself. Oh, that is so you. [Throws tomato at Squidward and walks away. Squidward grunts]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. How's it going?
Squidward: SpongeBob, oh, thank goodness. You have to forgive me.
SpongeBob: What for?
Squidward: For reading your diary.
SpongeBob: Oh, that. You know, Squidward, everyone was so amused by it, I had it published. It's a best seller, and I owe it all to you. [Holds up book titled "SpongeBob's Diary"] Besides, you only read my work diary. You've never even seen my secret personal diary. [Holds up a diary titled "My Secret Personal Diary" with a unicorn, smiley face, heart, and rainbow on the cover] Now, that would have been really embarrassing.
Nat: There he is! That diary reader! [Group of fish holding tomatoes show up] Let's get him!
Crowd: Yeah! [Shouting angrily at Squidward]
SpongeBob: People, people. Stop your assault. Through my art, as an author, I have forgiven Squidward.
Nat: Oh yeah, did you know he's reading your personal diary? [Squidward laughs while holding reading the diary]
SpongeBob: Squidward! How could you?!
[SpongeBob bursts into tears, then runs away once again. After SpongeBob runs away, the crowd throws tomatoes at Squidward yelling at him]
Squidward: I don't care. This is so worth it! [Squidward laughs]
French Narrator: ["The Goo Lagoon" sign is shown at Goo Lagoon] Ah, Goo Lagoon. A relaxing retreat for the citizens of Bikini Bottom. [The scene starts to pan through a wide shot of Goo Lagoon] A place for fun and frolic, but soon fun shall turn to fear, [The panning stops at the lagoon itself] for deadly danger creeps their way [creepy-looking words appear that read "IT CAME FROM GOO LAGOON!"] and it came from Goo Lagoon. [A female scream is heard] 
[The scene changes to show the bottom half of Dale exiting the lagoon. The scene pans up to reveal that he is licking a pink ice cream cone. The scene widens to show that he is passing Tommy with a red shovel and orange pale digging up sand and putting it in the pale, Scooter and Bill sunbathing, Nat rubbing sunscreen on Abigail-Marge's back, and Dennis playing volleyball with Nazz-Mimi. He stops just in time to see SpongeBob wearing his red swim suit and Patrick wearing a just light green swim suit and red swim cap pass by him. The scene follows Patrick and SpongeBob until they stop. They give each other excited faces and start laughing with excitement. They Run away from an oncoming tide. They chase the receding tide. They go back and forth two times. The scene zooms into show just their faces. They continue to laugh. The giant shadow of a giant wave emerges]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-oh.
[The scene pans out to show the giant wave. The two get submerged in the wave. The scene changes to the open lagoon. SpongeBob and Patrick's bottom half float into the scene. SpongeBob gets up and gasps. He turns Patrick right-side-up]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Do you know how to swim?
SpongeBob: No.
Patrick: Me neither.
SpongeBob: Hmm, I wonder why we're not sinking to the bottom of Goo Lagoon. [A big round purple object lifts Patrick into the air. Patrick screams] Patrick, you're floating!
Patrick: Oh. [another one lifts SpongeBob in the air] Hey, you're floating too! What happened?
SpongeBob: [He looks down at his object] These weird bubbles saved us.
Patrick: [He pokes on his bubble] It's all purple and sticky.
SpongeBob: [He sticks his hand on the bubble and stretches it a little] And it's really stretchy. It's some kind of goo bubble.
Patrick: [He smells the goo bubble] Well, the smell makes my nose tickle. [He sneezes which causes the bubble to bounce on the lagoon's surface. He giggles.] Hey, it bounces! 
[SpongeBob and Patrick smile at each other signifying that that are thinking to do the same thing. SpongeBob and Patrick bounce on the lagoon's surface like they're playing on hopping balls while laughing. SpongeBob bounces above Nat, who is is a doughnut-shaped pool floaty that has red and white stripes on it. Nat sighs. Patrick bounces on him causing him to go under the lagoon's surface. He emerges through the floaty and gasps for "air"]
Patrick: Sorry! 
[The scene changes to show on a surfer, who is normally the lifeguard, wearing Patrick like pants surfing on a wave. SpongeBob goes through the top of the wave and hits him on the head. This causes him to lose his balance and wipe out. The surfer reaches the surface and gasps for "air". Patrick also bounces on him, causing him to go back under the surface of the lagoon. The scene changes to show a group of water ski acrobats and Thaddeus is driving the boat. The group consists of: on the bottom, Blue Fred, Sadie, and an orange fish; in the middle, Sandals and Nazz-Mimi; on the top, Dale, who is holding two red flags. Patrick comes and bounces on the group, knocking them over. The scene changes to show Plankton selling chum in a cart on the beach, while wearing a farmer's hat and a red bandanna]
Plankton: Chum! Get your red, hot chum here! What's the deal? According to my algorithm, [He takes out a calculator with the number "102682" on it.] beach-goers should be famished [He throws the calculator behind him] and looking for a treat. A treat like chum! Hello? It's perfectly edible, people! [A pole destroys Plankton's chum cart and causes his outfit to fly away] Oh, come on, man! This is my livelihood! 
[The scene widens to show Squidward, wearing a blue swim suit, behind an orange beach chair putting up an orange and yellow umbrella, which was the thing that crushed Plankton's cart]
Squidward: [opens his umbrella] Ah, a beautiful day beachside. I couldn't think of a thing that could ruin this. [lays down on his chair]
Plankton: I could think of a few.
Squidward: [puts tanning lotion on his nose and lays down to tan with his tanning mirror. A big shadow appears above Squidward] Hey, you're blocking my light. [SpongeBob appears from the sky, laughing, and crashes into Squidward with his goo bubble. This causes Squidward to go under the sand and to destroy both the umbrella and the chair. Squidward pops out of the sand] SpongeBob. [Another shadow appear and Patrick's laughter is heard. Patrick appears and also crashes onto Squidward, who screams, with his goo bubble. Again, Squidward goes under the sand. Squidward pops out of the sand with his tanning mirrors stuck to his head like a flower's petals. Plankton walks up to Squidward]
Plankton: Ah, sweet karma. It can come from the most boneheaded of places. [He notices SpongeBob and Patrick bouncing on their goo bubbles while laughing] Wait a second. What are those bouncing blobs of goo?
Squidward: [growls] I don't know and I don't care! [SpongeBob and Patrick continue to bounce and laugh on their goo bubbles until Squidward steps in front of them] Hold it! [SpongeBob and Patrick stop bouncing and their bubble drop to the ground] What I want to know is why you two have ruined my attempts of having an even tan!
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Squidward. We're riding on these cool [He steps off the bubble and lifts it] goo bubbles. They're floating out of Goo Lagoon. 
[A strange robot comes out of the water and everyone screams and runs away in horror, except for SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward who are too shocked to move. The robot opens itself revealing that it was just a suit controlled by Sandy.]
Sandy: Stop! [She exits the suit] Those bubbles are dangerous!
Plankton: Dangerous?
SpongeBob: [The scene changes to show Squidward, Patrick and SpongeBob. Patrick and SpongeBob are holding their bubble separately] Fascinating. Tell us more.
Patrick: Yeah, but with visual aids.
Sandy: O-kay... [pushes a button on the front of her suit that opens up a projection screen while her tail holds a projector. The projection says "DANGER" (in red letters) "BENEATH THE SEA FLOOR" (in gold letters). The visual is of a normal undersea background] My scientific investigation has [the camera cuts to the projection screen] revealed that deep beneath the lagoon floor is a volcanic pocket of super goo. [The visual changes to show 5 layers: the top is the lagoon, the second is an light orange straight section that is probably the floor of the lagoon, the third is a red straight section that might be lava, the fourth section is straight and light brown and slightly smaller than the second layer, the fifth layer is a blackish straight layer that is about double the size of the third layer. The fifth layer also contains a purple section in the middle that has the words "SUPER GOO" in gold letters. The visual aid then shows a zig-zag section that goes from the super goo section all the way to the top of the second layerbottom of the lagoon] A crack has formed releasing bubbles of the goo to the surface which are toxic and very unstable.[The visual aid changes to show the crack at the bottom of the lagoon floor releasing super goo that forms a bubble. The bubble starts to morph and then it pops all over the visual aid.] At any moment, it could lose its integrity and boom! It'll explode!
[The scene changes to show Plankton next to a red bucket with a button panel on it.]
Plankton: That rodent's right. A giant goo bubble could really level the playing field. If someone were able to control its power, they'd control all of Bikini Bottom. And I'm going to be that someone. [lifts the panel's cover and pushes a red button on the bucket and door opens. The exterior is barely shown, but of what is shown, it looks similar to the Chum Bucket's lab interior. He goes inside and the door closes. The bucket sinks into the sand and a purple and light purple clam-shaped sub flies out and dives into the lagoon.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Patrick holding their goo bubbles separately.]
SpongeBob: It's so gooey. [stretches the goo bubble]
Patrick: [shoves the goo bubble into his mouth; muffled] I can fit it in my mouth. Oh, it tastes like licorice.
Squidward: [off-screen] You idiots! [the scene widens to show him] That goo is dangerous! Weren't you two morons listening?
Patrick: [muffled] No, not really. I drifted off.
SpongeBob: But just look at all the cool stuff it can do. [stretches the goo bubble and makes it into a form of a top hat] You can make a hat. [put it on his head and spreads the goo around his face] Or a beard.
Patrick: [Patrick wears the goo bubble on his head in a Elvis Presley hairstyle] Or an awesome toupée.
Squidward: Toupée? You mean hair? [grabs a goo bubble that is floating towards him and put it on his head. Then, he stretches it and makes it into hair] How do I look?
Sandy: What is wrong with you people?! That goo can destroy everything!
Patrick: [SpongeBob and his goo bubble are stuck on right side of Patrick's head] Seems safe to me.
Sandy: That's what they said about microwave ovens, dry cleaning, and corn dogs!
[The scene widens to show Squidward messing with his "hair" and Patrick and SpongeBob sitting on their bubbles]
SpongeBob: See you later, Sandy.
Patrick: Yeah, these goo bubbles won't bounce themselves. 
[Patrick and SpongeBob bounce away on their goo bubbles while Squidward continues to mess with his "hair"]
Sandy: You have been warned! 
[The bubble transition appears and the scene changes to show Sandals playing volleyball with Pilar. Pilar hits the ball too hard, it flies into the lagoon]
Sandals: Oh, man, where will we get another ball?
[The Scene widens to show SpongeBob bouncing on his bubble while holding a smaller goo bubble]
SpongeBob: Why not try a goo bubble? [He gives them the smaller goo bubble. He bounces away]
Pilar: Thanks. [the goo sticks to his fin] Hey, it sticks like glue! Go long! [Sandals runs off as Pilar throws the goo bubble. But since it was stuck to his fin, it sends him flying into the lagoon. He pops out] Awesome! I still got it! I wish I could swim. [sinks back in]
Thaddeus: [wipes his head] It's so hot. [SpongeBob and Patrick arrive, each on their goo bubble, and Patrick makes a beach umbrella out of a passing goo bubble that is smaller than then ones the two are sitting on] Oh, it's so cooling. [SpongeBob and Patrick bounce off] Thanks, goo!
Squidward: Thanks, goo!
Pilar: [under the lagoon] Thanks, goo!
Tommy, Sadie, Orange fish from earlier, Billy, Nazz-Mimi, and Brown girl fish: Thanks, goo!
[The scene widens to show that at least the last one was part of a newscast. Johnny is seen on the news anchor set on a TV screen]
Johnny Erain: And now we go to Perch Perkins [The image of the Bikini Bottomites goes away and is replaced by Perch Perkins in front of some passing goo bubble while light green letters in the upper-left corner of the screen that read "LIVE" are shown] at the scene!
[The scene zooms into the image of Perch Perkins and now fills the whole screen]
Perch Perkins: That's right! Perch Perkins here at Goo Lagoon, bringing you the latest on this Super Goo event. [walks up to SpongeBob] What do you think of Super Goo, young man?
SpongeBob: [He looks nervous for a second and remains silent for a moment until he looks at the camera. He smiles] I'm on TV!
Perch Perkins: [walks up to Patrick] And you, sir, what's your opinion? [Patrick doesn't say anything] Uh, sir?
Patrick: [grabs Perch's suit] It's awesome.
Perch Perkins: [chuckles nervously] That's great. Let's get some comments from some other beach goers. [Sandy runs up and grabs the microphone]
Sandy: I have a comment: Super Goo is evil! [eye twitches] Stay in your homes!
Perch Perkins: [angrily grabs his microphone back from Sandy] Yes, siree. The goo bubbles certainly are getting folks excited.
[The "LIVE" in the corner goes away]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [bouncing on their goo bubbles] We sure are excited! [laugh]
[The bubble transition appears and the scene changes to show Plankton's clam-shaped sub in the depth of the lagoon surrounded by goo bubbles. The scene changes to Plankton on the interior. He is sitting on reddish brown seat and holding a yoke with a red button and a green button on it]
Plankton: [continues his search for the crack formed from the super goo under the lagoon. He lets go of the yoke] I can't find this thing anywhere. [pulls out his binoculars and looks to the left of the vehicle] Come on, now. Think, Plankton. [he looks up] If you were a giant bubble of dangerous goo, where would you be? [he goes back to the left]
Karen: [pops up] Sheldon, this ship wasn't designed to reach these depths.
Plankton: That's great, sweetheart.
Karen: If you continue this search much longer, your power supply will deplete and you'll sink.
Plankton: All right, Karen. I'll make sure I write that down in my book, titled, Insignificant Things My Wife Told Me.
Karen: Whatever. Go get stuck at the bottom of Goo Lagoon. It's your funeral.
Plankton: What did you say?
Karen: I said, "Go get stuck at the bottom of Goo Lagoon."
Plankton: That's it, Karen! The goo bubble must be stuck at the bottom. We just have to get down there. Karen, cut the power to the entire ship. [Karen cuts the power and the ship starts sinking] Yes! [laughs evilly as his ship continues to sink until it finds the crack where the goo bubbles are coming from] Look, there it is! Karen, fire up the engine power. [Karen restarts the ship] With my mechanical clam digger, I'll crack open this goo-cano easy as a clam! Which is what it was built for, so... You know, that makes sense. [the ship lands into the crack as Plankton laughs evilly. Plankton pushes the button and the ship widens the crack] Yes! Yes! Bubble forth, my gooey wrath! [the lagoon floor begins to shake] And now to get the ding-dang out of here! [Plankton makes his getaway in his escape pod while the remains of his ship get swallowed up by the massive purple goo rising from the crack]
SpongeBob: Look! [a giant purple goo bubble forms out of the water] Giant goo bubble! [Sandy pops out from the sand under SpongeBob]
Sandy: See, I told ya! [breaths crazily] Run for your lives!
Patrick: Sandy's really getting out of hand. [cuts to black screen]
Perch Perkins: This is Perch Perkins reporting live from Goo Lagoon where I'm standing in front of what appears to be some sort of gigantic gooey bubble rising out of the water into the water. With me is Sandy Cheeks. Miss Cheeks, as Bikini Bottom's resident know-it-all, we look to you for answers. Who, what, how, why, when?
Sandy: Well, Perch, I won't really know anything until I run some tests but I can tell you it's pretty serious. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get going. [reveals that Perch is sitting in the boat with her along with SpongeBob and Patrick]
Perch Perkins: Oh, yes. Of course. [Perch jumps into the water and pops up while his microphone is short circuiting] This is Perch Perkins and I'm soaking wet. Back to you.
SpongeBob: Wow, it's so big!
Sandy: That there is a Texas-sized bubble! [picks up one of the oars] First, we'll check its tensile strength. [taps on the bubble a few times] Tight as a drum.
Patrick: [takes the oar from Sandy] Oh, I want to play the drum! [attempts to hit it until Sandy grabs the oar]
Sandy: No, Patrick, don't! That thing's volatile! There's no telling what kind of damage it'll cause if it pops!
Patrick: Oh, fine. Here. I don't need that old stick anyways. [jumps into the bubble but bounces back causing him to crash into SpongeBob and fall in the water. Water splashes on Sandy's helmet]
Sandy: [pulls them out and back into the boat] Come on, guys. We still have more tests to perform. I need a sample. Be a darling and hand me that there bucket. [SpongeBob gets up and has a bucket stuck on his bottom. Patrick giggles at that as Sandy takes the bucket and grabs a bit of goo from the bubble] Ok, SpongeBob, put a little bit of that gloop into this analyzer. [SpongeBob pours the goo in the mouth of Sandy's analyzer. The analyzer scans the goo but goes haywire as a paper spits out] This is worse than I thought.
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy. [makes a painting of Sandy out of goo with Patrick and giggles with him]
Sandy: How many times do I have to tell you that stuff's dangerous? Now, how are y'all gonna clean that gunk off?
SpongeBob: [both SpongeBob and Patrick's hand are covered with goo] Oh, yeah. Gross. Good thing I keep a spare set of hands. [two extra hands pop out of his head, takes off the goo stained hands off, and throws them in the water]
Patrick: Oh, yeah! [Patrick rips his arm off but nothing happens]
SpongeBob: Uh, I have a better idea. [a bottle of bubbles pop out of his head and he mixes the soap with its wand] Hold out your hands. [blows bubbles on Patrick's hands and the bubbles clean the goo off]
Patrick: Oh, they shine!
Sandy: Well, it seems to have stabilized. As long as it doesn't get any bigger, there's not too much to worry about. [ground rumbles] That ain't good. [the force of the rumble causes a tidal wave which sends SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy flying while screaming and crashing onto the beach]
Perch Perkins: So, Miss Cheeks, what's the prognosis?
Sandy: Well, Perch, it's my considered opinion that now would be a good time to-- [ground rumbles] --run like heck! [everyone runs and screams]
Perch Perkins: [on tv] Well, there you have it. This is Perch Perkins about to be swallowed by a giant wave. [the wave crashes onto Perch and the TV goes into color bars screen. Everyone at Goo Lagoon is running for their lives and screaming as the giant goo bubble rolls on the beach.]
Patrick: [runs to an outhouse] I'll catch up! I've gotta use the can! [close the door until the giant goo bubble rolls onto it]
SpongeBob: [trips over a rock] Whoa! [lands on his head in the sand and Sandy pulls him out. The giant goo bubble almost rolls over SpongeBob and Sandy and begins to float in the air above them]
Sandy: Phew, that was a close one.
Patrick: Help, help! Help! [punches through the door] I'm out of toilet paper in here! [the outhouse begins to slide off]
SpongeBob: Look out! [SpongeBob and Sandy run as the outhouse crashes onto the ground. Patrick hangs on for his life but he begins to slip while some of the goo sticks on him. He screams. SpongeBob is reaching out for Patrick while Sandy is carrying him by the feet] Hang on, buddy! Just a little bit more! [grabs Patrick by his foot] Gotcha! [tries to pull him down but loses his grip] I don't gotcha! Whoa! [SpongeBob and Sandy fall over as Patrick, who is still stuck on the goo, stretches up as the goo detaches causing him to fall right on top of the goo bubble]
Patrick: Help! [sobs as the goo bubble drifts away]
SpongeBob: Now what do we do?
Sandy: We need to get to my submarine! Fast! [Squidward is seen riding on his recumbent bicycle until Sandy grabs him be the arms] Squidward, it's an emergency! I'm gonna need your bike! [Sandy lifts Squidward off his bike and gets on] Hop on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob gets on and rides for a few seconds to Sandy's treedome. They get off and run inside]
Squidward: Sheesh, you'd think the sky was falling. [goo then splatters on top of Squidward] I am going to learn to keep my big mouth shut. [the goo bubble floats by the treedome as Patrick continues to scream until he begins to play with the goo. He then make a goo sculpture of SpongeBob]
Patrick: Howdy, SpongeBlob! I'm so glad you could stick around. [giggles] Glad. [SpongeBob and Sandy arrive in a submarine]
Sandy: [through her communicator] Hold on, Patrick! We're here to rescue you!
Patrick: Oh, go rescue somebody else. Can't you see I'm playing with my friend, SpongeBlob? [SpongeBob and Sandy look at each other in confusion. They fly above Patrick and release a grappling hook] Don't worry. I'll never leave you. [the hook grabs Patrick's head] Huh? [the hook pulls Patrick off the goo] No...! Good-bye, SpongeBlob! [Patrick gets pulled safely into the submarine as the hook left a dent on his head] Hi, SpongeBob! Hi, Sandy! [the goo bubble flies towards Bikini Bottom]
SpongeBob: So what do we do now, Sandy? That thing is headed straight for downtown Bikini Bottom.
Sandy: If that thing pops, we can kiss our beautiful town goodbye! [the townspeople takes Sandy's words too literally and starts to kiss the streets and the buildings and say goodbye to them. The goo bubble continues to fly above the city and rains goo on the townspeople and buildings. Everyone starts screaming. The bubble bends two skyscrapers. Cuts to the Bikini Bottom City Hall where a bride and a groom are getting married at the steps and the front door while everyone is cheering. A pile of goo splatters on top of the groom]
Groom: Help me, my beloved.
Bride: Don't touch me, you disgusting freak! [a drop of goo stains her wedding dress and she cries] My dress is ruined! [Sandy's sub flies underneath the bubble as it splatters goo on Nancy Suzy-Fish after she gasps]
Nancy's baby: [giggles] Mommy goopy! [goo splatters on Nancy's baby. Nancy runs away screaming with her baby while Tyler takes cover in a nearby trashcan. Once its safe, he sighs and climbs out covered in filth. The bubble continues to fly but this time towards the statue of King Neptune]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! It's headed right for Neptune's trident!
Sandy: I was afraid it might come to this. In order to save the city, we must destroy public property. [activates missiles at the bottom of her sub]
SpongeBob: Uh, Sandy, why do you have missiles in your sub?
Sandy: You know, in case I get stuck in traffic. Here goes! [pushes button and launches the missiles. The missiles make a direct hit on the statue, but they instead make it into a skeleton form] Darn it! [the goo bubble approaches and SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick scream. However, the bubble flies above the statue] Huh? What the--?
SpongeBob: That's weird. It's like that bubble has a mind of its own.
Sandy: Or the mind of someone else. Look! [it is revealed that Plankton has been moving the bubble by pushing it from behind while he is inside the escape pod. He sighs] Plankton! I knew it!
Plankton: Yeah, it's me.
Sandy: What are y'all up to this time?
Plankton: Well, that's for me to know and for you to clam up!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Rude!
Plankton: Let's just say I've got big plans for this little bubble. [laughs evilly as SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick stare at him in disgust] Now, if you'll excuse me I have to go. [proceeds in pushing the goo bubble. SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick pursue him until he activates a continuous track on his escape pod. They continue to chase him around the bubble until Plankton laughs and speeds up]
Sandy: Dang it! We'll never catch him at this rate!
Plankton: Ha! They'll never catch me at this rate! [yelps as he sees Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick coming towards him at the front]
Sandy: [comes out of her sub] Oh, no, you don't! [throws a lasso on Plankton's pod and ties the rope on the hook] Come here, you little varmint! You stay right there! Yippee! We got him now! [Sandy, SpongeBob and Patrick jump out and run towards him]
Plankton: That's right, come to Papa.
Sandy: When we get you out of there, you've got some explaining to do!
Patrick: [runs past SpongeBlob] Hey again, SpongeBlob!
Sandy: We've got you surrounded, Plankton! Now, come out with your antenna in the air!
Plankton: Oh, dear, I guess you've got me. Oh, wait a second-- [pushes a red button] No, you don't! [Plankton's pod flies off]
Sandy: Retreat! Retreat!
Plankton: Aw, don't go so soon. [pushes a yellow button. The pod activates a giant plug] I hope you brought your dancing shoes! [the plug stabs on the bubble cornering SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy] 'Cause it's time to do the electric goo-boogaloo! [pushes a green button and the plug electrocutes SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick which causes the townspeople below to scream in fear as Plankton laughs evilly. SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy are fried and Plankton pushes them off with the wind from his pod's rudder. As they fall, he continues to push the bubble. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy fall and scream until they crash to the ground]
Patrick: [Patrick and Sandy are shown to be unharmed from the impact of the fall] Good thing we landed on SpongeBob. [it reveals that SpongeBob's spongy body saved them but SpongeBob is squashed under them]
SpongeBob: Yeah, good thing. [Sandy jumps off]
Sandy: Plankton, you creepy bacteria! Give me back my sub! [Plankton throws Sandy's sub at them as it crashes to the ground. Sandy gasps] My sub!
SpongeBob: There, there Sandy.
Patrick: Plankton, you're-- you're a big meanie-weenie! You won't be such a tough guy without that big old bubble!
SpongeBob: Tough guy? Bubble? Patrick! Eureka! Inspiration!
Patrick: Really? [smells his armpit] Do I need deodorant?
SpongeBob: No, but you're close. What we need is [pulls out his bubble bottle from his head] liquid soap. It's time to fight bubble with bubble!
Patrick: [scoffs] Bubbles. That's your answer for everything. [cuts to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, come again! [goo splatters onto Mr. Krabs' eyes] Hey, who turned out the lights? [wipes off the goo and looks up to see the giant goo bubble in front of his restaurant]
Plankton: Hello, down there, Krabs! Look, I brought you a pretty balloon! And in return, you can give me the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Mr. Krabs: Why in the world would I want to do that?
Plankton: Cause if you don't, [his pod pulls out a needle] I'm gonna pop this disgusting thing and destroy Bikini Bottom! [then his pod holds out his computer with the picture of the Krusty Krab and Bikini Bottom on it] As you can see, I projected the blast radius of this goo-bomic balloon and it's gonna cover pretty much everything in town.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah? Well, I can't see nothing from down here!
Plankton: Oh, yeah? Well, look again, you dingus! [throws his computer down at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I won't be blackmailed! There's no way I'm giving you me secret formula!
Plankton: You heard him, Bikini Bottom! It's time to kiss clean goodbye! [prepares to pop the goo bubble as he laughs evilly, but is stopped by SpongeBob's voice]
SpongeBob: [standing on the Krusty Krab sign] Hey, you! Yeah, you! Hold it right there, mister!
Plankton: Eh, not again.
SpongeBob: Prepare to meet your match, you big, bubble bully! [Sandy is standing on the bubble bottle and stirs the liquid soap with a giant bubble wand]
Plankton: [his pod puts its needle away on its head] Well, this is interesting. Let's see where it goes.
Sandy: Thank Neptune for the Barg'N-Mart buck discount! [gives SpongeBob the giant bubble wand]
SpongeBob: Here goes. [jumps off the sign] Geroni-blow! [the bubble wand creates a big bubble which takes the form of a bubble giant] Pretty slick, huh? Get him! [the bubble giant runs towards Plankton]
Plankton: [gasps] Uh-oh.
Patrick: [slides down the pole] Whoo! [laughs] Oh, boy! Get him, you big bubble bruiser! [runs up in the middle of the confrontation] Whoo! [laughs] You're the man! Yay! [the bubble giant steps on Patrick's pointy head and begins to deflate and fly around]
Plankton: Okay, where were we? Oh, yeah! [grabs the needle and proceeds but the deflating bubble giant flies under and lifts the goo bubble higher and higher]
SpongeBob: There goes a real hero. He gave his life so we could stay clean. [the bubble giant lifts the goo bubble so high that it flies out of the ocean and into outer space. The bubble giant begins to evaporate as Plankton's face gets distorted a little while he grunts until he reaches space. The goo bubble bounces on the moon and hurdles back to Earth and into the ocean] Oh, no, he's coming back!
Sandy: And he's headin' right for us! [Plankton parachutes the bubble safely and slowly to the ground. The townspeople flee as SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs scream until the bubble stops on top of them]
Plankton: That's it, no more messing around! Give me that formula or I'll destroy this stinkin' town! [hold out the needle]
Mr. Krabs: But I don't wanna!
Nat Peterson: You'd better do what he says or we'll tear your restaurant apart and give it to him ourselves!
Bill: Yeah!
Martha Smith: I just washed my car!
Bill: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Ok, I'll do it.
Bill: Yeah! [Martha and Nat look at him strangely as Mr. Krabs goes into his restaurant and gets the bottle containing the secret formula]
Mr. Krabs: [hands Plankton the bottle] Here. I hope you choke on it.
Plankton: [retrieves the formula from Mr. Krabs and opens his window] I can't believe it! After all these years, it's mine! [cries tears of joy and wipes a tear away] I'm so happy, I could just burst! This bubble that is! [everyone gasps and Plankton ruthlessly pops the bubble and the town is covered in purple goo as he laughs evilly. Everyone including SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs are covered in goo]
SpongeBob: Oh, that dirty little double-timer!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry. He's about to get what's coming to him.
Plankton: [flies his pod and uses the windshield wipers to clean the goo off the window] Now to see what's inside a Krabby Patty! "Just one ingredient:..." [rolls down the paper as he continues to read only to find that there is a TNT dynamite attached to it] Darn it, Krabs! [the dynamite explodes inside the pod and it crash lands on the roof of the Chum Bucket] Ow. [Mr. Krabs laughs at Plankton's failure with joy]
Sandy: [annoyed] Well, I don't see what you're so gull darn happy about! This is a catastrophe!
Mr. Krabs: Well, darlin', it's like this: Where you see disaster, I see dollar signs. So, SpongeBob, you got any of that bubble soap left? [cuts to a line of people who are waiting to get cleaned up] Please have your money ready! [Nat gives Mr. Krabs his money] Thank you! [opens up his cashier] Right this way. [Nat walks up and gets picked up by the bubble giant. The giant eats Nat and swirls him around and around inside until it spits him out with its foot. Nat is now all sparkly clean. The bubble giant then picks up Martha and gets cleaned as well]
SpongeBob: [stands there watching with Patrick and Sandy, still covered in goo. He and Patrick look happy but Sandy looks confused] See, Patrick? Bubbles are the answer to everything! [laughs as episode ends]
Scallop: [crows like a rooster]
Squidward: [singing his vintage, "la-da-dee, la-da-do, la-da-dum] 20 minutes in the bath seems like enough. [has wrinkly hands] [sighs in excitement] Another day! [groans] Another day.
SpongeBob: [falls down the stairs like in "<a href="wikiMissing_Identity" title="Missing Identity">Missing Identity<a>"] Ready for work! [walks to Squidward] Good morning, Squidward, I... [spots he's still wearing his underwear] [gasps] Not ready for work! [falls up the stairs]
Squidward: Whatever.
SpongeBob: [runs up to Squidward] Thanks for waiting, Squidward.
Squidward: I wasn't waiting.
SpongeBob: [laughs] I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants.
Squidward: Yes, I saw that.
SpongeBob: I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?
Squidward: Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!
SpongeBob: I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut! [Squidward stops moving] [SpongeBob gasps] Squidward, what are you doing?! [SpongeBob tries to get Squidward to move, and falls onto the ground trying to do so]
Squidward: SpongeBob, look. [pointing to the Krusty Krab] We're walking in a straight line.
SpongeBob: I don't follow.
Squidward: A straight line is the shortest distance between any two points!
SpongeBob: Speak English, brainiac! [laughs]
Squidward: Well, see, you have point A [draws a red A in the sky], where you start, and then there's point... [Squidward draws curved lines in the sky] point...[erasing everything he wrote] I don't even know what I'm talking about!
SpongeBob: [the A falls on SpongeBob's tongue] Mmm, strawberry!
[bubble transition] [SpongeBob looks down on his clock]
SpongeBob's Clock: Tick!
SpongeBob: Oh no, now we're only going to be 14 minutes early for work! [running in circles frantically] Oh, there's got to be a shortcut around here somewhere!
Squidward: Oh, for the last time [drawing the straight line again] straight line, point A, there's no shortcut!
SpongeBob: There is always a shortcut!
Squidward: What moron told you that?
Patrick: [walking by] There's always a shortcut!
Squidward: [Realizing Patrick told SpongeBob that statement] Huh.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob puts on an explorer hat] Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!
Squidward: Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!
[exterior shot of the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs outside]
Mr. Krabs: Yoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're not going to come with me?
Squidward: No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there! [laughs] That's the face! That's the look! [laughs as Squidward walks to the Krusty Krab] [SpongeBob runs off the road to find the "shortcut"] [singing while going through many landmarks] First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut! [notices Squidward] Huh?
Squidward: Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it.
SpongeBob: Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged! [singing again, going through more landmarks] First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut! [laughs] There, that's better. [SpongeBob notices he's in a darker part of town] [laughs nervously] Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost! [SpongeBob imagines of what Sandy said to him]
Sandy: [in a thought bubble] First rule of wilderness training, is map out your course, by taking note of local landmarks!
[SpongeBob's imagination bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Local landmarks... [SpongeBob looks left and right spotting local landmarks] A-ha! [pointing to a large and unusual shell] Right at this large and unusual shell. [the creature under the shell emerges and walks away] Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant. [SpongeBob spots what appears to be the sign to the Krusty Krab] There it is, the Krusty Krab! [SpongeBob climbs over the fence to see it]
[the scene transitions to the real Krusty Krab, where we see various still images of the inside of the restaurant until we see Squidward relaxing]
Squidward: Ahhhh.... [Mr. Krabs appears]
Mr. Krabs: Well, look at this. Lazing about. [in a mocking voice] Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?
Squidward: No thanks, I got one! [Squidward pours himself a mug of cappuccino with an image of his face in it] Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause.
[the scene transitions back to SpongeBob, where SpongeBob finds what he thinks is the Krusty Krab. He comes right up to it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Krabby Krust?! [SpongeBob notices a guy painting signs] Is that the name of a restaurant?
Sal: No, it's a typo.
SpongeBob: Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?
Sal: Never heard of it.
SpongeBob: Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom! [SpongeBob hands the fish coupons] Here, take this coupons!
Sal: Thanks! I'm going to go there right now! [the fish hands his paintbrush to SpongeBob and drives away in his truck]
SpongeBob: I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now? [cries] [SpongeBob imagines Sandy again, who is hammering a tent to the ground. When Sandy talks to him, SpongeBob stops crying]
Sandy: [in thought bubble] Remember, your landmarks!
[SpongeBob's imagination bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money! [SpongeBob goes back the way he came] Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came... [running in circles] I'M LOST! [screams, until he spots the broken fire hydrant he previously saw] Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant! [sits down near the hydrant] Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant! [SpongeBob notices many broken fire hydrants] So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out. [sees a payphone] Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone. [walks to it] Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it. [shakes himself upside down; a dime falls out] My last dime. [picks up phone] I hope this works. [puts dime in coin slot. The cash register phone rings at the Krusty Krab. Squidward groans and answers it]
Squidward: Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?
SpongeBob: It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone.
Squidward: You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?
SpongeBob: Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?! [beep from the phone]
Operator: If you'd like to continue this call, please insert another dime.
SpongeBob: I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?
Operator: If you'd like to know where you are, please insert another dime.
SpongeBob: Uh, hold on! [SpongeBob runs to the abandoned sofa, where three tough-looking fish are sitting on it drinking sodas (the main one sitting in the center, Scott, resembles <a href="wikiHarold" title="Harold" class="mw-redirect">Harold<a>). He digs his hands under the cushions, and finds two nickels] Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!
Scott: What are ya doing?
SpongeBob: Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!
Scott: This is our abandoned sofa, pal!
[Scott and the fish to the left of him, who resembles <a href="wikiScooter" title="Scooter">Scooter<a>, give off mean looks to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: What ya doing there, drinking soda?
Scott: What's it tooya!
SpongeBob: Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?
Scott: [he and the fish to the right of him, who resembles <a href="wikiCharlie" title="Charlie">Charlie<a>, give off surprised looks. Scott gets off the sofa and approaches SpongeBob] Hey, listen! I know this gigantic soda isn't good for me, but sometimes it gives me the kick I need to start my busy day as a pedicab driver!
SpongeBob: Ooh, you drive a pedicab?
Scott: Yes, sir! [Scott puts on a pedicab driver's hat and grabs his pedicab, which SpongeBob gets into] You need a ride somewhere?
SpongeBob: Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it! [Scott drives away]
Scooter: Way to go, Scott!
Charlie: Yeah, he's almost saved enough to attend a community college next year! [he and Scooter clench their soda together and continue to drink them]
[Scott drops SpongeBob off at what appears to be the Krusty Krab again]
SpongeBob: [gets off of the pedicab] Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school! [SpongeBob notices the sign] Krusty Klam?! [gasps] Wait, Scott, come back! [Scott drives away, leaving SpongeBob behind] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob begins frantically running, and checks his clock]
SpongeBob's Clock: Tock!
SpongeBob: No! Over the cliff! [jumps off the cliff into the muck] Through the toxic runoff! [runs through a sewer pipe] Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe! [SpongeBob slides out of the sewer pipe] Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire! [SpongeBob falls down with wires attached to him] Up this massive hill! [SpongeBob grows so tired he falls down flat on his face] That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early! [SpongeBob crawls his way to the Krusty Krab] [SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab]I made it! I made it! [SpongeBob hugs two customers] Oh, random Krusty Krab patrients! How I've missed out! [SpongeBob jumps onto an old fish's lap and kisses her] Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces! [the scene then cuts to outside the bathroom with SpongeBob in it] I missed the bathroom, too! [two fish come running out screaming] [SpongeBob approaches a fish choking on his Krabby Patty] But most of all, I missed you, choking guy! [SpongeBob hugs the choking fish who spits out his chewed-up Krabby Patty, which lands on Patrick's Krabby Patty] [SpongeBob notices Patrick] Patrick? How did you get here?
Patrick: Same way I always do. Scott gave me a ride in his pedicab. [Scott, in his pedicab, appears outside and winks]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob notices Squidward] Squidward! Squidward, can you believe I made it?! [Old Man Jenkins appears to be hanging from the razor-wires on SpongeBob, and groans]
Squidward: Congratulations. [Mr. Krabs appears]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pushes SpongeBob off of him] Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that! [shot of SpongeBob looking like a wreck] You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath! [Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob outside]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir!
Squidward: What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!
Mr. Krabs: Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!
Squidward: I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin! [Squidward runs outside, and gets himself dirty by rolling in dirt, ripping off his shirt, and pouring dirt on his head] Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?! [Mr. Krabs sprays Squidward with a hose]
Mr. Krabs: There you go! [a truck passes by and drives over a puddle, spraying Squidward, who is already laying in the puddle, with more water] Now get to work! [Sal exits out of his truck]
Sal: Uh, you guys open? I have coupons! "Buy one, get one free!"
Mr. Krabs: Oh no! It says "Buy one for a fee!"
Sal: Oh! I stand corrected! [Mr. Krabs and Sal walk offscreen, leaving Squidward in the puddle, as the episode ends]
Mr. Krabs: [scene starts at Krusty Krab] [to Nat] And how is everything for you today, sir?
Nat: Oh, it's great! Just great!
Mr. Krabs: Fine, fine.
Nat: I just love this Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, okay, always nice to hear. [starts walking away]
Nat: My Krabby Patty is a Krabby Patty and both buns are also Krabby Patties! [Krabs suddenly stops walking, eyes widen] So luxurious!
Mr. Krabs: [runs back, takes the patty from Nat, and looks at it as his pupil turn into dollar signs] You must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that!
Nat: No extra. It's the same low price as a regular Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [pupil dollar signs rip] Argh! [faints. Squidward sprinkles salt on him and he screams] Me eyes! What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?! [Squidward sprinkles more salt on him and he screams again]
Squidward: I couldn't find a smelling salt, so I just used table salt.
Fred: Hey, my Krabby Patty is just a bun! And the two buns... are also buns. Stale buns.
Tom: [teary-eyed] My patty tastes like sadness.
Mr. Krabs: All right, that's enough. Patties with emotional flavors... [gets up, grunting] ...it's two bits extra. Now pay at the register. What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Mr. Squidward?!
Squidward: What do you think? SpongeBob's in one of his moods. He failed his boating exam...again.
Mr. Krabs: Well, we can't have that. He's me best employee. Well, no offense.
Squidward: None taken.
Mr. Krabs: Melancholy and self-doubt are bad for business. Make a note of it. [walks to the kitchen]
Squidward: Let me grab a pencil. [to himself] Ha, it's funny, cause I mean the opposite. Ha.
[there are patties, covered in condiments, smushed in the window. SpongeBob is sobbing, lying on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: [enters] Avast there, lad! [steps on SpongeBob's foot, causing him to stand up] You're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [sniffles] Oh, I can't even cry right! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: There, there. Failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over.
SpongeBob: Oh, I've been in driving school as long as I can remember, and I still don't have my license!
Mr. Krabs: How much do they charge you at this driving school of yours?
SpongeBob: [stops crying] Oh, about $100 a semester.
Mr. Krabs: $100 a semester?! [pupils again turn into dollar signs] Well, I can do it for double the price and half the time!
SpongeBob: [happily] Really?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, I taught me own daughter Pearl how to drive like a little angel.
[Pearl drives through the kitchen, moving the grill and the vat of grease from its spot, all while putting on makeup]
Pearl: Hi, Daddy! I need money for shoes.
Mr. Krabs: Sure, anything for me little angel Pearl. [gives Pearl money from his wallet]
Pearl: Thanks, Daddy! [drives out of the kitchen, leaving a hole in the other wall]
[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs in a driving boat]
SpongeBob: Uh, are you sure about this, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a... [air quotes] "professional" to teach you how to drive.
SpongeBob: You know, Mr. Krabs, at boating school, Mrs. Puff...
Mr. Krabs: Wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son! It's all a racket.
SpongeBob: [gasps in shock] It is?
Mr. Krabs: [points to SpongeBob] And that goes for every kind of schooling. Why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. Now, put 'er in gear!
SpongeBob: [gives a thumbs-up] Okay! [starts the boat, but then accidentally reverses it, destroying the Krusty Krab sign]
Mr. Krabs: [nervously chuckles] Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time.
SpongeBob: It does?
Mr. Krabs: No, but you got the right fire in your belly.
SpongeBob: I do?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Yeah. Well, you know, what we need is a change of venue.
[bubble transition to the Mr. Krabs driving the boat in an empty parking lot]
Mr. Krabs: This empty parking lot is just the ticket. [parks the boat] Like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstacle-free space and the freedom to make mistakes. [switches places with SpongeBob, making him the driver and Mr. Krabs the passenger]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're so wise.
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles before putting his seatbelt on] Can't disagree with you there. All right, put 'er in gear! [SpongeBob again quickly reverses the boat, destroying the Krusty Krab entrance] Hmm.
SpongeBob: Rookie mistake, right?
Mr. Krabs: I suppose so. Now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage.
SpongeBob: Inch, inch. Inch, inch, inch. Inch, inch. [does so, but doesn't notice an anchor in the back, destroying the whole front of the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [checks his mirrors] Oh, broken wall. That's about $15,000. Oh, kitchen fire. Oh, that'll be about 6 grand. [sees Squidward hitting a customer, Harold, with a spatula] Ooh, lawsuit? Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Ugh. [his eyes deflate, but they quickly return back to normal] [thinking in his head] All right, Krabs. Get a hold of yourself. You've been in worse fixes than this. Why, you've stared down the cannon's mouth, haven't ya? Look at that face. [sees SpongeBob's smile] Bleah! Is this the face of your final defeat? Is it, Krabs? [sees SpongeBob's smile more creepy, while also heavily breathing]
[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's house driveway]
Mr. Krabs: Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll say.
Mr. Krabs: Just take a look around, boy-o: home sweet home. Nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. Oh, just the opposite, in fact. A place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night. [sees SpongeBob asleep with covers and Beary the teddy bear before waking him up with the horn] Oh, brother. Let's start with something simple: a little trip down the street to Patrick's house. [starts buckling his seatbelt, until...]
SpongeBob: Patrick's house! [crashes into Patrick's house, flipping Mr. Krabs off the boat and makes a crash landing into the Krusty Krab]
Harv: [steps over Mr. Krabs] I'll have one Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: Okay.
Mr. Krabs: [to Squidward] Upsell!
Squidward: [sighs] [to Harv] Would you like fries with that?
Harv: Yeah, sounds good.
Mr. Krabs: [to Squidward] Better.
[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's driveway]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until I say, "Put 'er into gear." [opens the passenger door, but after he said "put 'er into gear," SpongeBob drives the car away from Mr. Krabs, causing the passenger door to come off the boat. SpongeBob then crashes into the Krusty Krab again. The boat is on top of a destroyed table]
Squidward: You missed one. [the engine of the boat falls off it and destroys a before unbroken table]
[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's driveway]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] A simple trip to Patrick's house: a line so straight and true.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk.
Mr. Krabs: Well, we, you know, we could do that. But you can't learn to drive without a boat. [gets an idea] Or can ye?
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob at the arcade]
Mr. Krabs: You'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art technological simulator.
[shot shows SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs standing in front of a driving arcade game]
Mr. Krabs: Now hand me one of them tokens. [SpongeBob takes out a token. Mr. Krabs inserts it in the coin slot. The game turns on. SpongeBob sits in the seat] You'll need your protective headgear. [Mr. Krabs puts a helmet with goggles on SpongeBob]
Computer on Screen: Ready? Drive!
[the screen shows pixelated SpongeBob driving a boat to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs! I'm driving the boat! [the screen shows The Krusty Krab spproaching SpongeBob] Uh-oh. [brakes and a crash are heard. SpongeBob puts up his googles and sees that the arcade game has crashed into the top of the real-life Krusty Krab]
Computer on Screen: Sixth place! [the arcade game falls in the Krusty Krab]
[bubble transition to the boat parked on the road again. A worker goes down a ladder while fixing the broken Krusty Krab, when SpongeBob drives into the Krusty Krab sign, breaking it. The worker climbs back up the ladder. Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the boat yet again]
SpongeBob: Hey, look, Mr. Krabs. I'm driving!
Mr. Krabs: Great job, boy. [gasps as the boat goes up a ramp and crashes into the Krusty Krab sign, which flips the boat into the Krusty Krab, destroying it yet again]
[bubble transition to the boat now going through a pipe on the roof of the Krusty Krab, then smashing its doors, while the worker hammers the roof]
Worker: Phew. [the boat crashes on the worker]
[bubble transition to the boat breaking a "One Way" sign as Mr. Krabs gasps, then screams with SpongeBob as SpongeBob drives the wrong way on the road, avoiding other boats and a gasoline truck. The boat then goes out of control for a few seconds before stopping on the road again]
SpongeBob: Well, at least I didn't hit the Krusty Krab that time. [chuckles nervously. The scene cuts to the other boats that were avoiding Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob crashing into the Krusty Krab, including the gasoline truck exploding the Krusty Krab with Squidward left standing]
[bubble transition to the worker giving Mr. Krabs a bill until SpongeBob crashes into the Krusty Krab once more and the worker then increases the bill]
Mr. Krabs: Saw that coming.
[bubble transition to a sad SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. The fire in my belly has gone... [imitates explosion]]
Mr. Krabs: No, no. It's my fault. We've been going about this all wrong, boy. It's not a pampering you'd be needing. It's a bold and reckless display of confidence!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs: You think when I was your age, I tip-toed around like a tadpole on a petunia?
SpongeBob: You never!
Mr. Krabs: That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping. [snaps his claws]
SpongeBob: [while snapping his fingers] Snapping!
[bubble transition to a busy highway with many signs around]
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh.
Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows. The dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of Bikini Bottom. To your starboard, you yield. To your port, they yield to you. And when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest!
SpongeBob: [shocked] Man, I don't think I'm ready for this, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [hugs SpongeBob] Nonsense, boy-o. All it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. Why, your little pet snail could do it. [puts Gary on the steering wheel]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Uh, I thought you were just using Gary as a colorful example, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, he's colorful, all right. But he's also going to teach you how to drive. Now, go! [Gary drives on the roundabout successfully, watching a lot of signs, while SpongeBob covers his eyes] Atta boy! [after a few seconds, Gary pulls over] There you go, SpongeBob. Did you see how Gary did that?
SpongeBob: [opens his eyes] Uh, yeah, some of it.
Mr. Krabs: Buck up, me boy-o. [points to SpongeBob] It's your turn next.
SpongeBob: [happily] My turn? Gee, Mr. Krabs, you must really believe in me.
Mr. Krabs: [while he and SpongeBob get out of the boat] Not really.
[a police motorcycle stops by the boat]
Police officer: Sir, is this your vehicle?
Mr. Krabs: Why, yes. Yes, officer, it is.
Police officer: And did I just see you let a snail negotiate this vehicle through a dangerous intersection?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] You sure did...uh, I mean, you didn't...I mean, well, no...I mean, well, yes...I mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example: a colorful example. [pats SpongeBob] I was teaching the lad to drive.
Police officer: By putting a snail behind the wheel.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Officer, I don't have the boating handbook with me, but...
Mr. Krabs: [interrupts SpongeBob] Quiet, boy! Let me handle this.
Police officer: Are you a licensed driving instructor, sir?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Well, no. But I taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. Do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer?
Police officer: [while writing on a piece of paper] No, I'm married to my job.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Well, um...you two seem very happy together.
Police officer: Well, we've had our ups and downs, but after some couples counseling, we think we've worked out our issues. [continues writing on the paper]
Mr. Krabs: [looks at a smiling SpongeBob] This ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy.
SpongeBob: [happily] Whoa! My first real traffic ticket.
Police officer: [to Mr. Krabs] Oh, this is going to require something more than money, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Ha! What could be worse than spending money? [looks at the written paper, then gasps]
[scene cuts to Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Mrs. Puff: All right, class. Please say hello to our newest classmate...Mr. Krabs!
Class [except SpongeBob]: Hello, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [whispers to Mr. Krabs] Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes.
[episode ends]
SpongeBob: Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?
Squidward: [SpongeBob is trying to put up a banner] A little higher. A little to the left. A little more to the left.[SpongeBob falls over] Ha- Perfect! [A barrel rolls along the floor, hits a ladder which hits a table into Squidward's head] Oww.
SpongeBob: [Mr. Krabs emerges from his office very happy, playing a concertina] Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!
Squidward: [crossly]No, he doesn't!
SpongeBob: But just look at him go!
Squidward: This is the day he gets the patty orders for the big Founder's Day eating contest, it's the most money Krabs makes all year.
SpongeBob: Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town.
Mr. Krabs: [slides down the rail] Nope, Squidward's right. Not only do I supply the Eating Contest but I get to sell my profilating patties to all the hungry spectators! I had to grease a few wheels but it was worth it. [Cuts to flashback]
Commissioner: Thanks Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, Mr. Commissioner! See you at Founders' Day! [Mr. Krabs coughs after the commissioner drives off and smokes hits his mouth. Cuts out of flashback]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Oh, I wonder how many Krabby Patties I can sell!♪
Squidward: Wonder no longer, you only need one.
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] ♪!lles nac I seittaP ybbarK ynam woh rednow I ,ho♪ [Grabs Squidward] What do you mean one?!
Squidward: Didn't you see today's newspaper?[Shows Mr. Krabs the paper]
Mr. Krabs: [Reads paper] "No takers for "McNulty Challenge". Ha! What's that suppose to mean?
Squidward: He's the current champion. He only needs to eat one patty to win.
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] I'm ruined! No-one wants to see a one Krabby Patty Eating Contest, least of all me wallet. [Starts crying]
SpongeBob: Hey at least we have Founders Day!
Mr. Krabs: I couldn't give a seafit for Founders Day. I need sales boy, sales is what I need. Oh if only there was someone dumb and hungry enough to take on Ol' Oswald McNulty.
Patrick: [Walks by humming]
Patrick: [Stupidly talking to a broom  ] I'll just have 47 Krabby Patties, please. I had a big breakfast so I'm not that hungry. [Patrick grabs the broom.] Squidward did you get a new haircut?
Mr. Krabs: Ah! Dumb and hungry. Well, if it isn't Patrick!
Patrick: I isn't Patrick?
Mr. Krabs: No, no of course you are! How would you like to eat as many Krabby Patties as you can handle and restore the honor of your home town.
Patrick: I like the first part but I don't understand the second part.
Mr. Krabs: I'm talking about Oswald McNulty! He comes here every year with his big city ways and his extremely relaxed throat muscles and he shows us up a bunch of rubes. Rubes! And on Founders Day no less! We need a home-town hero to make me lots of mone- I mean return the belt to Bikini Bottom! He-he, He-he.[Cuts to next scene.]
Mr. Krabs: You're going up against the best, so you have to be the best! We're gonna light a fire under you boy-o!
Patrick: [Panicking and stupidly] Ah! Oh no, that's gonna hurt!
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, Mister. No more fooling around, you're here to eat and eat and then eat some more.
Patrick: [Enthusiastically] I like to eat!
Mr. Krabs: Well let's see how your tummy handles these patties Mr. likes-to-eat.
Patrick: [Patrick starts laughing] Ha-ha-ha, you said tummy.
SpongeBob: Tummies! Ha-ha-ha [Mr. Krabs blows whistle]
Patrick: [Enthusiastically] I like whistles!
Mr. Krabs: Eat!
[Mr. Krabs starts the timer and Patrick takes a Krabby Patty and starts sniffing it and then eats it slowly.]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doin'? Your wastin' time!
Patrick: Gotta warm up my taste buds first. [shows Patrick's mouth then shows his taste buds cheering and they take the bits of Krabby Patty he eats.]
Mr. Krabs: Son, can you eat faster?
Patrick: Oh, faster? [Mr. Krabs starts the timer again and Patrick starts eating faster]
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs stops timer.] Four and a half patties in one minute! Well McNulty can eat a hundred in a minute! But you know I think your teeth might be getting in the way a little bit-
Patrick: Oh, why didn't you say so. [Patrick takes out his teeth.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, I didn't know you had false teeth.
Patrick: [laughs] I don't
Mr. Krabs: Nah, that can't be it, McNulty has teeth. SpongeBob! Let's go to the film. [SpongeBob turns on film projector and shows McNulty eating Krabby Patties.]
Mr. Krabs: Look at that devious face, a face without pity, cold dead eyes, like a sharks eyes. What is Oswald McNulty doin' that Patrick Star is not!
Patrick: His homework?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Or maybe we should be asking what Oswald McNulty is not doing.
SpongeBob: His taxes?
Mr. Krabs: Your both wrong! Or possibly right, I mean I don't know much about his personal life, the point is, he's not tasting boys, [shows McNulty's taste buds which aren't in use.] That's where Oswald McNulty has  the edge! Those extra seconds you take to taste a patty Patrick, are slowing you down! From now on [grabs Patrick's head and puts a patty in his mouth and puts his head down to swallow it.] You must put them in yer mouth, then swallow!
Patrick: [sadly] I don't get to taste?
SpongeBob: [worriedly] This feels wrong Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [Sternly]Don't act bad bucket boy, we're gonna need a hundred more patties.
SpongeBob: Okay, i'll get right on it. [walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: We're gonna teach this sea star, a new way to eat! Without tasting. [Mr. Krabs pulls out Patrick's tongue then it shows his taste buds crying, then the scene cuts to Patrick starting training and eating patties.]
Fred: There he goes!
Thaddeus: Our champion!
Sadie: He's so dreamy![one of them fall over]
[everybody is cheering for him.]
Mr. Krabs: [while throwing Krabby Patties to Patrick] Come one, come all! This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! It's a Founders Day extravaganza! Watch our home town hero, Patrick Star, take on the down the beloved champion from three towns over, Oswald McNulty! And see who takes, The Patty Belt!
Diner Fish: Say, can my little boy ask you something?
Boy with a Broken Foot: Are you the brave man that's gonna bring the belt back to Bikini Bottom?
Patrick: [Tries to say something but can't cause he's eating a Krabby Patty and then he gets some of the patty he was chewing on the two fish.]
Diner Fish: Inspiring words!
Boy with a Broken Foot: I hurted my foot on the playground.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, that's wonderful, move back. Be sure to bring your friends![they drive away and it bubble transitions to The Krusty Krab with a big crowd cheering and the contest is about to happen, then two guards bring Oswald McNulty and every one starts booing.]
Boy with a Broken Foot: Dad, is that the bad man who took the belt away from Bikini Bottom?
Diner Fish: Yes it is son. [both start booing.]
Perch Perkins: Looks like this crowd is hungry! For excitement that is, and also possibly food, any moment now these doors will open on what promises to be the most dynamic patty eating contest, in Founders Day history.
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patties, T-shirts, conical hats, and, Patrick's chompers!
Perch Perkins: Today, our local hero, Patrick Star, the courageous underdog, is going against five time belt winner, Oswald McNulty from three towns over, one can only imagine the seeding tension pulling over right now, between these two titans of the sport, as they prepare for ultimate battle.
Patrick: [Scene cuts inside Krusty Krab where Patrick and Oswald are sitting casually from each other]Hey.
Oswald McNulty: How's it going.
[SpongeBob and Squidward bring out the Krabby Patties.]
Perch Perkins: [holds a plate of Krabby Patties.] Five short minutes to consume as many patties as they can.
SpongeBob: Who's ready!
Patrick: SpongeBob, I don't wanna do this.
SpongeBob: Well then don't do it, i'm sure Mr. Krabs will understand.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffing.] I smell mutiny, what's going on here?
Patrick: I don't want to eat in the contest it hurts my taste feelings. [points to his tongue and his taste buds are crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no problem, [pulls out a paper]
Patrick: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: That, is a bill, for all those Krabby Patties you ate during training. [drops bill on the table for it to roll out very long, and the crowd is cheering.]
Patrick: But I didn't know I had to pay!
Mr. Krabs: Well I didn't know either until you decided you weren't doing the contest, and that means all your training patties, just became plain, eating patties. Now if you was to do the contest, I might be inclined to tear up this here little bill, and of course, there are all the people counting on you son. [Mr. Krabs points to the crowd and the Boy with a Broken Foot.]
Boy with a Broken Foot: Ow, my foot. [Patrick looks at him and feels sad.]
Patrick: Okay, i'll do it for the little boy with the hurt foot.
Mr. Krabs: [tearing the bill.] You made the right choice kid! [laughs and then Squidward rings the bell.]
Perch Perkins: There's the bell! And we're off and eating. [McNulty starts eating] McNulty taking an early lead and really going to work with those patties, what a dynamo! A little skull from three towns over eating at a terrific pace! But what's this? [shows Patrick struggling to eat a single Krabby Patty.] Patrick Star isn't moving, he seems stuck in the gate!
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing Patrick? Don't make me charge you for those patties too!
Perch Perkins: McNulty is pressing forward, looks like this is gonna be a blowout!
Boy with a Broken Foot: Patrick, [wearing Patrick merchandise] I believe in you Patrick. [Patrick is about to cry but he then starts eating.]
Perch Perkins: But wait! Patrick Star is on the move, patties are starting to disappear, look at that little sea star eat! He's inching closer to McNulty, and it look like McNulty can feel the heat, never have there been a more pretentious display of competitive eating! The amount of patties being consumed is astounding. [Patrick finishes a whole plate of patties and is starting to suck everything in.] And now, yes, yes! Patrick Star has matched Oswald McNulty! And they are tied as they come into the home stretch! Both eaters are so full they could barely eat but eat they do, moving so slowly now. One can't help but wonder if they are going to hit the patty wall at some point. And, and, [both McNulty and Patrick stop eating and fall on the table.] Both eaters have stopped! With only seconds left, we are tied in patties eaten, and neither one seems to have the room to go on! Oh! What is this? [McNulty falls down.] And down goes McNulty, down goes McNulty! [the crowd is cheering] It looks like we do have a tie!
Patrick: It's over SpongeBob, I can't go on.
SpongeBob: The taste, Patrick, [pulls Patrick's tongue and slaps it.] Remember the taste!
Patrick: The taste. [Patrick gets up and stands on the table pointing.]
Perch Perkins: What's this? Patrick Star has risen from his seat, and is pointing to center field,[points somewhere else.] No wait! He's pointing to a little boy with a hurt foot. [Patrick points to his mouth.] Ladies and gentleman, he's pointing to his mouth, as if to indicate something
Boy with a Broken Foot: [holds out a Krabby Patty.] Here you go champ, you can have one. [Patrick sticks his tongue out and  the boy puts the Krabby Patty in his mouth and his taste buds carry it to his mouth, and then he eats and finishes it.]
Perch Perkins: And, he's eating! He's eating! The Great Starbino, is eating! [Patrick's nine hundred ninety nine became a thousand and broke the counting machine, and the crowd is cheering.] Patrick Star wins! The belt is back in Bikini Bottom! The belt is back in Bikini Bottom!
Commissioner: Here you go son, you earned it fat and square. [Patrick holds up the belt and puts it on]
Perch Perkins: Congratulations, Starbino. So, are you gonna defend the belt next year?
Patrick: No, this thing doesn't even fit! [ tries to get it off and then shoots off of him and hits the Boy with a Broken Foot.]
Boy with a Broken Foot: Ow! My other foot.
[the screen fades to black and then the episode ends.]
Johnny Elaine: [on TV] News flash! A severe rip current may soon touch down in Bikini Bottom! Residents are warned to bar all windows and stay indoors!
[The rip current sends the television flying off screen. Numerous objects like Dave hammering boards on his window, a can of beans, a bone, a house, and a cow. The television comes back with Frank the Whale following behind.]
Johnny Elaine: [on TV] Save yourselves!
[Below the rip current, Mr. Krabs, who appears to be in a cranky mood, is heading towards the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, rip current, schmip current! Ain't nothin'.
[Mr. Krabs enters the restaurant and meets up with SpongeBob and Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs, do you think the rip current will hit the Krusty Krab?
[SpongeBob makes strange moments of what will happen to the restaurant when the rip current strikes.]
Squidward: Uh, shouldn't we clear the docks? Or batten down the patches? Or whatever people say?
Mr. Krabs: Calm your waters. [points to the danger meter on his knee] Me sailor's knee says we're not in danger. See? Now, get back to work!
Octavius Rex: Excuse me. Are we in any kind of peril?
Customer 1: I think we should all go home.
Mr. Krabs: As soon as you buy some patties to go, you can go.
Orchid: I'll have three Krabby Patties. [a loud rumble shakes the restaurant] On second thought, cancel that order!
[Mr. Krabs grabs the lady's purse and dumps her money in Squidward's cash register.]
Mr. Krabs: No takie-backsies! Three Krabby Patties.
[Mr. Krabs' money detector goes off.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Me money detector! Where do ya think you're goin'? Get back in there and spend the rest of your money!
Clay: But I needed it for rent!
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, everybody! New store policy! All money brought into this store must be spent here!
Buddy: Tyrant!
[Mr. Krabs sneaks up behind Buddy.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, tyrant am I? Alright, I'm a tyrant! The worst in all the seven seas! One of 'em! [growls]
SpongeBob: Gee, why is Mr. Krabs so crabby today?
Squidward: Probably because it's pay day.
[Mr. Krabs grabs the microphone.]
Mr. Krabs: Pay day's been canceled! Now, hear this! I'm captain of the ship! Captain Krabs! And I say no rip current will ever harm the Krusty Krab!
[Suddenly, a sunken ship flies down and the anchor crashes through the roof of the Krusty Krab. The ship pulls the restaurant off the ground and sends it flying into the air. The movements make the customers fly back and forth. Squidward gets his legs tangled to a pole. SpongeBob attempts to flip Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs struggles to hold on the register boat, but ended up getting bombarded with barrels. Despite his injuries, he checks the danger meter on his sailor's knee. He taps on it and the pointer moves to the red section.]
Mr. Krabs: Darn arthritis!
[The chain snaps off the ship's anchor and the restaurant is flying out of control. Mr. Krabs falls in a barrel. The customers and Squidward struggle to hold on as the rip current carries the restaurant away from Bikini Bottom. In a desperate attempt to save everyone, SpongeBob jumps out of the kitchen and uses his teeth to make a key out of his spatula. He opens the chest and pulls down the lever. Outside, it activates sails and a rudder. SpongeBob grabs a table and uses it as a steering wheel. The restaurant is now safely being steered through the rip current. Squidward, who was squished under a customer's butt, comes down from the pole.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, while I steer you tell everyone we're safe.
Squidward: [through microphone] It's alright now, everybody! Everything's under control now! And whatever!
[The customers climb down the mast.]
Octavius Rex: Three cheers for Squidward!
Customer 1: The guy who saved our lives!
Buddy: Let's make him our new captain!
Octavius Rex: Hip, hip...
Customers: Hooray for Captain Squidward!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Squidward! Uh, I mean Captain Squidward!
[Mr. Krabs, who is still stuck in a barrel, rolls between Squidward and the customers.]
Mr. Krabs: What's the meanin' of this?
Octavius Rex: What should we do with this tyrant, Captain Squidward?
Mr. Krabs: Captain Squidward?
Customer 1: Let's flog him!
Customers: Yeah!
Buddy: Let's tie him to the mast!
Customers: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Let's put the past behind us and start all over!
Customers: No!
Mr. Krabs: This is mutiny! Listen here, Squidward! Fun is fun, but get me outta here!
Squidward: Sorry. I don't think that's the captain's job. You're on your own.
[SpongeBob inexplicably jumps off the register boat, leaving the restaurant steering out of control.]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody, can we take a time out? This is Mr. Krabs we're talking about. The worst tyrant in the seven seas.
Mr. Krabs: You're not helpin', boy.
SpongeBob: You remember Mr. Krabs. He's the man who brought you the Krabby Patty.
[The customers murmur in agreement. As SpongeBob is lecturing everyone, Mr. Krabs is being rolled back and forth in the barrel.]
SpongeBob: And he's the man who brought you the Double Krabby Patty. And the Krabby Patty with cheese. And the Bratty Patty for kids.
Mr. Krabs: Um, little help here!
SpongeBob: He also created the Chatty Patty for teens. And who can forget the Hatty Patty. The patty you wear as a hat.
Thaddeus: I wear it because I'm bald.
Octavius Rex: Well, I guess any man who invented the Hatty Patty can't be all bad. Okay, let's get him out.
[But before they do so, Mr. Krabs is sliding towards the front doors and is being hurled out.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! Man overboard! [screams]
SpongeBob: NO! MR. KRABS!
Squidward: Well, I guess that solves that problem.
[Thaddeus takes off his Hatty Patty to honor Mr. Krabs' supposed death. He then eats the Hatty Patty.]
SpongeBob: I know you'll come back to us, Mr. Krabs!
[The Krusty Krabs flies through the rip current and the screen fades black. The screen turns back to the inside of the restaurant.]
SpongeBob: Until then, [takes out a dollar, licks it, and pastes it on the doors] I'll leave a dollar in the window for ya.
Octavius Rex: Hey, it's Captain Squidward's fault that we lost the man who invented the Hatty Patty!
Customer 1: Yeah! We're freckled! And we say you're the tyrant now!
Customers: Yeah!
Squidward: Uh, uh, don't be hasty! Remember, I'm... I'm still the captain! The Hatty Patty was my idea!
Octavius Rex: But we're still stuck in this rip current!
Customer 1: We'll never get out!
[Octavius Rex and the unnamed customer corners Squidward, but Squidward gets his head tangled into the spinning steering wheel.]
Squidward: Oh, barnacles!
[With Squidward tangled in the steering wheel, the rudder turns left and right and the restaurant flies out of control. The customers fly back and forth again. Squidward pulls his head out of the steering and his head spins back into place. The restaurant spins out of the rip current and crash lands safely on the ground.]
Octavius Rex: We're alive! Captain Squidward steered us out of the rip current!
Customer 1: How about a cheer for Captain Squidward!
[The customers cheer.]
Squidward: Thank you! Thank you! Just doin' my job as captain protecting my crew.
SpongeBob: Whoa! Where are we?
[SpongeBob and the customers look out the window and what they see is a beautiful landscape with plants growing everywhere. An unnamed sea creature flies around.]
Clay: Oh, look at that. That's amazing.
Octavius Rex: This neighborhood's crazy! I wonder if there are any good places to eat.
Customer 1: You think maybe they got a Krusty Krab around here?
Buddy: Hey, good idea! I could go for a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: I'm calling the local Krusty Krab right now.
[SpongeBob pulls part of his head off and forms it into a telephone. He dials the number. The Krusty Krab phone rings.]
Squidward: Hello, Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Yes, I'd like to place an order.
[Squidward pushes the receiver into SpongeBob's head in frustration. The receiver rings in SpongeBob's head. Suddenly, a monster appears at the front door, scaring the customers. Squidward runs away in fright, leaving a puddle of ink behind. The monster spreads its slimy tongue around the customers.]
Octavius Rex: Captain!
Buddy: You gotta save us!
[The monster licks SpongeBob's eyeballs off his face.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Captain Squidward!
[SpongeBob's eyes jump back on his face. Squidward is nowhere to be seen. The monster wraps his tongue all over SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Um, I know where he is.
[SpongeBob runs into the kitchen and opens the closet. He throws everything out and pulls a box out with the word "fragile" on it. He opens the box and finds another box with the word "pickles" on it. He opens it, pulls out a jar, and takes Squidward out of the jar.]
SpongeBob: Uh, Captain, sorry to interrupt, but the crew needs you to protect them.
Squidward: Are you crazy? I can't fight a monster!
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm afraid the crew insists, sir.
[The customers, with random weapons, growl in anger and Squidward becomes nervous. The customers carry Squidward out of the kitchen.]
Squidward: I don't want to be captain! I don't want to be captain!
[SpongeBob gives Squidward a mop for him to fight and the customers throw him out. But instead of fighting the monster like he's supposed to, he ends up getting eaten. Everyone is stunned.]
Octavius Rex: Well, that was anti-climatic.
Customer 1: Maybe he'll make the monster sick.
Clay: Okay. Who had their money on Captain Squidward? Pay up.
[SpongeBob gives Clay and Buddy some of his money.]
SpongeBob: Well, somebody has to step up, fight that monster, and become captain! And that somebody is me!
[SpongeBob pulls up his pants. He pulls out his left eyeball, blows on it, rubs it and puts it back on. He smells his breath, which smelled terrible. He drinks some mouth wash, gargles, and swallows it. He does karate moves but notices his shoe is untied. He ties his shoe. He trips his nails. And finally, he pulls a loose string off his pants.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what was I doing now?
[Suddenly, everyone hears a distant scream from above. The scream turned out the but none other than Mr. Krabs, who comes crashing through the roof and landing on a table. However, Mr. Krabs is still angry about Squidward being in charge.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're alive! Oh, welcome back, captain!
Mr. Krabs: Haven't you forgotten something? I am not captain anymore! Squidward is!
SpongeBob: Uh, uh. The monster ate him. We need a captain and that's you! Isn't that right?
[The customers chatter in agreement.]
Mr. Krabs: Why would I want to be captain to such a sorry bunch of lubbers? I'm through!
[The monster's tentacle breaks through the window.]
Mr. Krabs: And that's comin' out of your pay!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, this job calls for a dictator like you!
[Mr. Krabs selfishly pouts like a spoiled child. The monster's tentacle breaks through the window again.]
SpongeBob: Do something, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Beg me.
Customers: Please, please, please!
SpongeBob: We're begging you! Please!
[The monster licks everywhere and Mr. Krabs gets covered in saliva.]
Mr. Krabs: Not buyin' it.
Customers: Oh, come on! We'll do anything! Please!
[Mr. Krabs still acts like a spoiled child and continues to pout. SpongeBob gets an idea and runs into Mr. Krabs' office. He grabs Mr. Krabs' first dime.]
SpongeBob: Got it! [runs back] Do you know what this is, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I don't care.
SpongeBob: It's the first dime you ever earned and I'm going to tear it up if you don't go back to being the meanie we need!
Mr. Krabs: I said I don't care.
SpongeBob: Okay, here goes!
[SpongeBob attempts to break it, but to no avail. He tries to cut it with an axe, but it shatters to dust. He tries to saw it in half with a power saw, but instead it makes the saw fly off, hitting someone offscreen.]
Unnamed man: My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Ha! You lose!
[SpongeBob mopes as he is about to give up. However, he got another idea.]
SpongeBob: Well then, I'm gonna do the worst thing I can do to your old dime!
Mr. Krabs: Oh yeah? What's that?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Spend it.
[This time, Mr. Krabs reacts in a gasp and becomes nervous. SpongeBob walks over to a candy machine and is about to use his dime to spend it on candy.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no you don't! Come here!
[Mr. Krabs jumps on SpongeBob and gives back the first dime.]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, everybody! What am I?
Customers: Umm... uh..
[The monster's tentacle breaks through the window again.]
Mr. Krabs: Come on! It starts with a T!
SpongeBob: A tree?
[Mr. Krabs glares at SpongeBob.]
Customer 2: A teddy bear?
Octavius Rex: A tuba?
Buddy: You're a tyrant?
Mr. Krabs: I can't hear you!
Customers: A tyrant! [cheers]
Mr. Krabs: Correct! Alright, I'll save ya. But you gotta promise to spend most of your, all of your money right here! Got it?
[The customers chatter in agreement. The monster breaks through the front doors and spreads his tongue all over the place, scaring the customers.]
Mr. Krabs: [hands SpongeBob his dime] Hold on to me dime, boy-yo.
[Mr. Krabs charges out of the restaurant and he and the monster hurls towards each other as they are ready to fight. The monster opens his mouth and eats Mr. Krabs whole. Everyone is stunned.]
Octavius Rex: Well, that was anti-climatic.
Customer 1: Again.
[However, Mr. Krabs is still alive and is beating up the monster inside. He makes the monster spit Squidward out. Squidward frantically runs back into the restaurant. Mr. Krabs punches one of the monster's eyes out and swings down. He bounces on one of its tentacles and lands on its head. He then bangs on the monster's eyes like he's playing bongo drums. SpongeBob, Squidward, and the customers dance in rhythm. The monster shakes Mr. Krabs off his head and sends him flying into a coral plant. But Mr. Krabs comes out of the plant and flies directly into the monster's hand. The monster pulls Mr. Krabs' legs off and pulls off his right arm.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute! Gimme that!
[Mr. Krabs hits the monster on his head and makes him let go. Mr. Krabs then sends the monster flying with his severed arm and puts it back on. The monster collides with a boulder and breaks into tiny monsters. The tiny monsters run away and everyone in the Krusty Krab cheers. The scene changes to SpongeBob giving Mr. Krabs his first dime while they're sitting on the roof of the restaurant.]
SpongeBob: Here you go, Mr. Krabs. You earned it.
Mr. Krabs: Well, boy-yo, you believed in me. So, today will be a pay day for you.
Squidward: What about me?
Mr. Krabs: You, Ex-Captain Squidward, have gone from pay day to mayday! Mush! Every last one of ya! All the way back to Bikini Bottom! [laughs]
[The episode ends with Squidward and the customers pulling the Krusty Krab back to Bikini Bottom while SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs sit on the roof.]
TV Announcer: We interrupt this program to bring you a Bikini Bottom News Flash!
[Robotic seahorse races out of the Chum Bucket, controlled by Plankton. Robotic horse neighs.]
Plankton: Whoa, big fella!
Perch Perkins: Mr. Plankton, we've received a word that you're plotting to infiltrate the Krusty Krab and steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. [shoves Plankton a microphone to speak to] Is that true?
Plankton: [thinks for a while] Actually, yes, that is true. I've got it all worked out. [shows point-of-view of the cameraman] First I break into the safe, and... [looks back] Huh? Wait, is this live?
Perch Perkins: Yes!
[Cameraman moves closer to Plankton. Plankton gets angry and uses a lever to eject a springing punchfist.]
Plankton: Don't broadcast my secret plans! They're secret! [cameraman appears again. Plankton slams his head onto the camera screen.] I will destroy all of you! [cameraman's camera cuts]
[Plankton respires very quickly. He then wears a cowboy hat.]
Plankton: Secret formula, ho! [whips Robot Seahorse and it races to the Krusty Krab.]
[Arrives at the Krusty Krab. Plankton ties it to the Krusty Krab sign to park his Robot Seahorse.]
Plankton: [Texas accent] I reckon that classified taste mixture will be in my hands directly. [spits into a golden pot]
[Plankton walks to the Krusty Krab. Robot Seahorse sneezes a metal nut, which happens to crush Plankton, landing into the gold pot. Plankton gets up, shown with a squashed, hexagon-shaped head.]
Plankton: [spits] Ow! [shakes his head quickly. Stares through the Krusty Krab door to see Mr. Krabs' office with an open vault and exposed Krabby Patty Secret Formula. Laughs evilly] The fool! He left the safe open! [presses a button to make his rocket missile appear. It blasts off randomly, but soon moves straight toward the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: Open for business, baby! [zooms past the customers in the Krusty Krab, then crashes into a paper drawing of the vault.]
Mr. Krabs: [cheeky laugh. Jumps out of his desk, tears off paper] Gotcha! [rolls paper into a scroll]
[Mr. Krabs puts salt on the paper and feeds it to the robot seahorse.]
Plankton: Urrgh!
[Mr. Krabs laughs and goes back inside the restaurant. The scene changes to Plankton watching Mr. Krabs making a delivery with his Krusty Katering truck.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm off to make a delivery. [enters the truck and drops one of the patties]
Plankton: Ha, that fool!
[Plankton runs out of the Chum Bucket, picks up the fallen patty, and takes it to his laboratory. Plankton begins analyzing it with his microscope.]
Plankton: And the Krabby Patty is made of...
[Karen removes the bun and hordes of sea urchins come out.]
Plankton: Urchins!
Karen: Ew! Ew! [runs away]
Mr. Krabs: [appears on his analyzer] Gotcha! [laughs]
[The urchins cover up Plankton's lab. The scene changes to Plankton flying to the Krusty Krab with his antennas acting as propellers. He snatches a patty from a customer.]
Plankton: Yoink!
Customer: Huh?
Plankton: [laughs] Yes!
Mr. Krabs: Pull!
[SpongeBob pulls the lever and activates the catapult.]
Mr. Krabs: Yee-haw! [laughs and grabs the patty]
[Plankton falls to the ground. Mr. Krabs lands safety like a plane.]
Mr. Krabs: Gotcha! [laughs]
[The scene changes to Plankton drilling a hole behind the safe with his laser. Mr. Krabs takes the formula and stuffs the safe with a jellyfish hive. Plankton opens the hole and gets stung by jellyfish.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Gotcha.
[The scene changes to Plankton hiding in a barrel seat. He sees a customer going to sit at his table and jumps into his pocket. Plankton jumps into the customers drink and gets slurped into his body.]
Plankton: Whee! [lands in the customer's stomach] Come to daddy, patty!
[The customer eats the patty. Plankton catches the patty and laughs.]
Mr. Krabs: [appears in the customer's stomach as well] Gotcha. [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs takes the patty out of the customer's stomach. Plankton becomes enraged and is fed up with his failures. He stomps on his antennas in frustration. The scene cuts back to the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: Oh, Karen, he covered me in urchins, fed me to a seahorse, and stung me to death! I fly through the air, he flies through the air! I hide in a stomach, he hides in a stomach! I have had enough!
Karen: Oh, I think someone needs their ba-ba. [feeds Plankton a bottle of milk] There, isn't that better?
Plankton: [throws bottle away] No, Karen! That's just not gonna work anymore! Don't you see? We're done here.
Karen: He said for the 9 billionth time. You know, Sheldon, if I had a dime for every time you... [gets unplugged by Plankton]
[Plankton claps his hands to turn off the lights. He walks out of the Chum Bucket with a phonograph. He plays the record with the song, "Taps." He pushes the button on the remote and the Chum Bucket's hand buries the restaurant. The hand waves good-bye to Plankton and disappears. Plankton puts a sign that says, "Gone Retirin'" on the shovel and moves out with his suitcase. Mr. Krabs is washing the windows with SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, did you see that? Plankton is retiring.
Mr. Krabs: I'll believes it when I sees it.
[A bus pulls over and picks up Plankton. Plankton tosses a coin into the coin dispenser. He sheds a tear just as the bus drives away.]
Mr. Krabs: [takes out a fishing pole] Hey, ha ha! [hooks onto the bus] All hands on deck, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, Mr.—Whoa!
[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and uses him as a water ski just as the bus drags them away.]
SpongeBob: Aw, you want to say good-bye to Plankton, you old softy you.
Mr. Krabs: That'll be the day! I don't trust Plankton as far as I throw him! That's why we're gonna shadow that little twit and find out what he's up to!
French Narrator: 82 kilometers later...
[The bus stops near a sign that says, "Dullsville."]
SpongeBob: "Welcome to Dullsville, a charmingly boring..."
Mr. Krabs: [shuts SpongeBob's mouth] Snap your trap, boy-o! You'll blow our cover!
[Plankton is seen shopping at Dullsville's shopping center.]
Plankton: A new life in a new town! [laughs evilly]
[Plankton enters the shoe store. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are disguising as an elderly couple and watches Plankton.]
SpongeBob: I still don't see Plankton doing anything wrong. Maybe he really is retiring.
Mr. Krabs: Believes it when I sees it.
[They put their masks on as Plankton comes out with his new pair of shoes. He walks off with his shopping cart.]
Mr. Krabs: Quick, boy, he's getting away!
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob jump out of their costumes. A mother and her son come by and sees the costumes flutter down. They scream in terror and run away. The scene changes to Plankton arriving at a retirement home called, "Dullsville Senior Living." He enters the retirement home and rings the bell at the reception area.]
Clerk: Yes?
Plankton: I'd like a room, please.
Clerk: Very good, sir. [grabs Plankton and writes down on clipboard, thinking he's a pen] How long will you be staying with us?
[The clerk drops Plankton and grabs a real pen.]
Plankton: Forever. [An old man's squishes Plankton with his walker and proceeds to smear him on the floor while Plankton yells.]
[Plankton enters his room with his stuff.]
Plankton: And so begins my retirement! [laughs manically]
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are clinging on the ceiling fan.]
Mr. Krabs: You see there, lad? Plankton is up to no good! I bet those are all the fixings for another evil lab.
SpongeBob: [his skin turns green] Mr. Krabs, I'm gonna be sick.
Plankton: [laughs as he unpacks his boxes] Yes! [puts on belt] Yes! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: You see? He's got an evil belt to match those evil shoes!
[Plankton unpacks another box and breaks a pair of glasses in half. He combs his antenna. He removes his eyebrow and replaces it with tape to look like an old retired man. He looks at himself in the mirror.]
Plankton: Yes! My plan is almost complete! [laughs manically]
Mr. Krabs: His plan! [shakes SpongeBob] Did you hear that, SpongeBob? He said, "plan!"
SpongeBob: Uh, please don't shake me, Mr. Krabs.
[Plankton opens his chair.]
Plankton: Oh, my pretty. You'll be my best friend from now on. [laughs] Retirement is mine! Mine! Mine! [laughs manically]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, this is it, boy-o. He's got an evil laser death apparatus contraption ready to spring on all of us!
[Plankton stops laughing. He jumps on the chair, grabs some popcorn and goes to watch television. The ceiling fan cracks.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh.
[The fan breaks and falls off the ceiling, sending SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs crashing on top of Plankton.]
Mr. Krabs: Now that I sees it, I believes it.
SpongeBob: Hurray! I knew you'd get it, Mr. [gets sick] Krabs! [runs into the bathroom and throws up]
Plankton: Krabs?! What are you doing in my hotel room?!
Mr. Krabs: [stammers] Oh. [shakes hands with Plankton] Good luck on your retirement, Plankton. I won't give you any more trouble.
Plankton: Oh, I know you won't, Krabs, because I'm at the Krusty Krab right now stealing that formula.
Mr. Krabs: Oh-oh, sure. Whatever you say, old-timer. How would you be doing that when you're all the way over here in Dullsville, hmm?
Plankton: [laughs] Because I'm a decoy look-alike robot!
[Plankton rips off his skin to reveal that he is a robot.]
Robot Plankton: Gotcha! [laughs]
[SpongeBob comes back out from the bathroom.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] So what'd I miss?
Both: What?!
[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, the real Plankton is sneaking into Mr. Krabs' office.]
Plankton: [through walkie-talkie] That's right, Karen. By the time those two knuckleheads figure it out, I'll be knee-deep in secret formula. [laughs] Yes, I'll wear my galoshes. Gotta go.
[Plankton jumps onto the safe, puts some explosive clay on it, and molds it into the shape of Mr. Krabs.]
Plankton: In your face, Krabs! Ha!
[Plankton blows up the safe and grabs the formula. He bumps into Mr. Krabs.]
Plankton: Krabs? SpongeBoob? W-w-why aren't you in Dullsville?
Mr. Krabs: We never left, Sheldon. The Mr. Krabs and SpongeBoob who followed the robot you to Dullsville were also robots. Gotcha! [laughs]
Plankton: [grumbles] Hate! Hate! [bangs his head against the floor] Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
[Back at the Dullsville's Senior Living, the robot Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob reveal themselves as robots to the robot Plankton.]
Robot SpongeBob: So the way I see it, Mr. Krabs and Plankton are just using us as pawns in their dumb secret formula war.
Robot Plankton: Agreed.
Robot Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I mean, who cares if that guy steals the secret formula anyway? Grow up, that's what I say.
Robot Plankton: Agreed.
[Cuts back at the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: So you're the real Krabs and SpongeBob. [grabs formula] Gimme that! [runs off]
Both: Ooh. [yells]
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob chase Plankton around the restaurant. As they chase, they started a brawl, which gets all of the customers and Squidward involved. During the brawl, the phone rings.]
SpongeBob: [answers the phone] Hello? Krusty Krab, may I take your order? No, Mr. Krabs is unable to come to the phone right now. He's trapped under a dust cloud brawl. Yeah, he'll have to call you back. [hangs up the phone] Gee, I hope our robot look-alikes are okay. Bless their heart-like pneumatic pumps.
[The robot SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton look-alikes are having a fun time together. They chew on nuts and bolts, eat a car engine, play on the playground, play volleyball and soak up in a hottub. They stand on the Dullsville sign.]
Robot Plankton, Robot SpongeBob, and Robot Mr. Krabs: Yay! [explode]
The Greek Chorus: Behold! We are the Greek Chorus! We narrate this epic tale of stupidity!
[Title card music plays, and soon the opening credits appear. The episode starts afterwards.]
The Greek Chorus: [all clear throats together] Behold Neptune, god of the sea, [Neptune arrives] with his mighty trident, a weapon so powerful, [King Neptune picks his teeth, then flicks off the food gunk.] nothing is beyond its user's reach! Behold the Kraken! [Big squid-like monster appears. It makes a roaring scream and sprays saliva over The Greek Chorus] Gross monster.
[The Kraken continues roaring. King Neptune fights against the monster with his trident. He creates a lightning fist and punches the Kraken to make it go very far away.]
The Greek Chorus: Behold Neptune triumphant! [King Neptune combs his hair with his trident] What an awesome dude! [King Neptune goes on his golden smartphone. SpongeBob walking with his spatula in his pocket and reading a comic book as he walks] Behold this idiot and beware, for trident trouble comes!
[SpongeBob accidentally knocks into King Neptune, who happens to be still on his smartphone.]
SpongeBob: Sorry. [picks up King Neptune's trident by mistake. Both walk off, all not knowing the change.]
The Greek Chorus: See?
[SpongeBob walks to the Krusty Krab, still reading his comic book as he walks. Mayhem in the Krusty Krab where every fish acts psychopathic.]
Customers: [repetitively chanting] Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!
Fred: Food! Food! Ah. [takes SpongeBob's comic book. He eats it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, I was still reading that! [force-opens Fred's mouth and reads the last few pages of the comic]
Squidward: Forget the stupid comic! We've got a situation here! We don't have any Krabby Patties, and these animals are trying to eat us instead! [a customer eats Squidward's arm. Squidward is stunned, then looks at his eaten arm.] Hey, who's responsible for this? [revealed an old lady ate his arm, then she slurps it up, and then picks her teeth with a toothpick.]
Mr. Krabs: [sounding scared] Get to flipping those patties fast, boy-o! Before we all become the lunch special!
SpongeBob: I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen through the kitchen window hole, smacking through the "bowling pins" of ketchup and mustard bottles. "Order here" sign now reads "Strike!." Fred chomps off a piece of the sign.]
[SpongeBob takes some patties from his Krusty Krab employee hat, pushes them into him, then blows them out through the top of his head, onto the grill. SpongeBob swings Neptune's trident like a baton.]
SpongeBob: [suddenly notices masses of unchopped tomatoes and lettuces] Oh, the toppings haven't been prepped! I wish this lettuce and tomato would just cut themselves up! [trident magically turns the tomatoes and lettuce alive.]
Tomato #1: [with a knife and a cleaver] Let's do this!
Lettuce: Yeah! Cut me up good, girlfriend! [clicks fingers]
[Tomatoes and lettuce chop each other up]
SpongeBob: Huh. I guess I did chop the toppings up after all.
Squidward: 37 Krabby Patties! Fast! [Customers grab Squidward and eat his hat]
SpongeBob: 37 patties? How am I gonna flip 37 patties? [pauses] Huh, has my spatula always had three heads? [attempts to use trident as a spatula]
The Greek Chorus: [comes out of the cupboard] No! And it is not a spatula.
Mr. Krabs: Get them patties out here fast SpongeBob! [customers grab Mr. Krabs by the eye, leaving his clothes] Arrgh!
SpongeBob: Oh, I wish these Krabby Patties would just serve themselves so I could keep cooking. [trident magically assembles Krabby Patties into friendly living characters]
Krabby Patty #1: Hey! [starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patty #2: Yay! [also starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patty #3: Yeah! [once again also starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patties: [all start clapping his hands above their heads. Happily walking out of the kitchen] Woo! Woo! Woo!
SpongeBob: Whoa, my spatula never did that before.
Krabby Patties: [all start calling out in high-pitched voices] Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!
[customers stop trying to eat Mr. Krabs and Squidward and instead enjoy watching the Krabby Patties dance around.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Mr. Krabs rockets out money, literally rising with joy.] I don't know how you're doing this, boy-o, but keep it up! Folks will pay every cent they have to watch Krabby Patties dance! Look at how cute they are!
[Shows Krabby Patties jumping into a fish's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: [surprised] We're running out of these dancing patties! Faster, boy-o! Faster!
[SpongeBob races to the kitchen in attempt to make more of the dancing patties with his trident.]
SpongeBob: [keeps making prodding motions with the trident] Dance! Come on, dance! I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! [taps against a trident prong] I'm trying! [shakes trident] Come on, you, work!
Neptune's Trident: [grunts and moans]
The Greek Chorus: [opens the kitchen cupboard again. Gasps] The sponge has angered the trident. [covers their faces] Trouble comes. [instantly closes the cupboard doors]
[SpongeBob finally gets the trident to work. However, instead of making dancing Krabby Patties like before, the patties become wild and carnivorous. The monstrous Krabby Patties jump out of the kitchen and attack the customers. The customers run out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: No! This is gonna cost me money!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I wish you wouldn't worry about money at a time like this!
[The trident zaps Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Right you are, boy-o! [give SpongeBob money and then gives everyone else money with his wheel barrel] Here, take this! Here you go! I can't stop! [runs off while continuously giving away money] There you go! What's happening to me?!
SpongeBob: What is going on around here?
Neptune's Trident: Ahem. [points to switch]
SpongeBob: Hey, what's this? [flips switch and makes the trident bigger] Whoa! My spatula is magic!
The Greek Chorus: Magic, magic, magic.
SpongeBob: This is awesome! I will use this magic spatula to help everyone.
[SpongeBob runs off to test the trident. The scene changes to SpongeBob walking down the street with the trident.]
Ivy: I'll have two, please.
[The baby loses his pacifier and cries. SpongeBob takes notice of the baby's dilemma.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I'll help you, baby! Boing!
[He shoots some of the trident's power and walks off. The trident's magic makes the pacifier into a monster. The monster pacifier grabs and eats the baby. SpongeBob takes notice of a man trying to grow his grass.]
Harold: What's wrong, grass? Why won't you grow? Talk to me. [hovers the ground]
[SpongeBob shoots some of the trident's power at the ground and grows grass. SpongeBob turns and leaves. However, unbeknownst to him, the grass grew larger and come alive.]
Grass: We'll do more than just talk to yous! Let's see how you like getting mowed!
[The magic grass chase Harold with the lawn mower. SpongeBob climbs onto a rock.]
SpongeBob: There is no problem I cannot solve, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea! [trident magically turns SpongeBob into a God] Hey, get outta here, you pesky jellyfish!
The Greek Chorus: Whoa, slow your roll! Only Neptune, true ruler of the sea, can control the trident.
Neptune's Trident: [laughs]
[Meanwhile, King Neptune is having a chat with his wife, Queen Amphitrite.]
King Neptune: So I say, "Look, Zeus, either you come up with more money or Neptune walks."
[Queen Amphitrite laughs. However, she becomes scared and hides in the sand.]
Baby Kraken: There he is, ma! That's the man who hit me! [sobs]
Mother Kraken: Don't cry, baby. Mother will handle this. [snarls]
King Neptune: Let us battle! [takes out SpongeBob's  spatula] Take that! [splatters grease on the mother Kraken's dress]
Mother Kraken: Huh? This is dry-clean only, you monster!
King Neptune: [looks at spatula] "Property of SpongeBob?"
[The mother Kraken roars.]
King Neptune: Uh-oh.
[The mother Kraken punches King Neptune far out into the distance. The scene changes to Patrick eating an ice cream cone just as SpongeBob arrives.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. You look so sparkly today.
SpongeBob: Of course I do, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea. [light shines down on SpongeBob]
Patrick: Oh. [Patrick's ice cream melts] No! My ice cream! Ooh, why is the world so full of pain? [sobs and eats the cone]
SpongeBob: Fear not, bestest of friends. You shall have all the ice cream you could ever eat!
The Greek Chorus: No, you'll only make it worse!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to bring an ice cream truck to Patrick. However, the trident drops the truck and makes it flat, making dozens of ice cream fall out.]
Patrick: Ahhh! Best day ever! [grabs some ice cream]
Ice Cream Man: No, worse day ever. [slips] Oh, my back.
The Greek Chorus: See?
SpongeBob: I can fix this!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to repair the truck and put all of the ice cream back.]
Ice Cream Man: Hooray! [rides away]
Patrick: Boo!
SpongeBob: I think I know a way to make you both happy.
The Greek Chorus: You really don't. How do you not get that by now?
[SpongeBob climbs on top of Patrick's head and uses the trident's power form a geyser that spews ice cream from the ground.]
Patrick: An ice cream geyser!
[Patrick plugs his mouth through the opening of the geyser and eats a vast amount of ice cream. In doing so, he ends up getting stuck at the very top of the geyser and gets brain-freeze.]
Patrick: Brain freeze! I can't eat it all! Ah, I've never been more disappointed in myself.
[The geyser sends a torrent of ice cream and floods most of Bikini Bottom. People are running for their lives to escape the flood.]
Medley Fishbowl: Ooh, I like choc...[gets caught in the torrent]
Fred: [floats on a cherry] Oh, the creamy delicious horror.
Patrick: Save us, SpongeBob! Save us! No wait. [eats some more ice cream] Okay, now save us!
SpongeBob: Stop, ice cream! Stop! Stop!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to stop the geyser. Patrick lands safely on the ground. However, the geyser erupts ice cream again.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I just made it worse! Patrick, I've ruined everything.
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, I wouldn't say that.
[SpongeBob and Patrick then see Shubie and her husband chasing the giant pacifier with their baby in its mouth run by.]
Shubie: Our baby!
Harold: I'll never mow you again!
[SpongeBob and Patrick see Harold being chased by the living grass with a mower run by before Mr. Krabs appears while running after four fish while throwing money.]
Mr. Krabs: Take me money!
Patrick: [gets hit by a coin thrown at him] Ow! Okay, SpongeBob, you ruined everything.
SpongeBob: No sponge should have this much power.
The Greek Chorus: We told you so.
SpongeBob: [irritated]Not helping!
King Neptune: Well, maybe I can help. I believe I have something of yours. [holds up spatula]
SpongeBob: My spatula! T-Then what's this?
King Neptune: That is my trident!
SpongeBob: Well, take your trident. I don't want it anymore.
[The trident zaps King Neptune.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Stop! That wasn't me.
The Greek Chorus: Too long away from its true master, the trident has run wild.
Male Greek Singer: What a jerk.
Neptune's Trident: [laughs and shoots bolts]
SpongeBob: Sorry! Pardon me! It's stuck!
[King Neptune fights off the trident's power with SpongeBob's spatula.]
SpongeBob: Ahh! Make it stop!
[King Neptune continues to fight until he manages to snatch the trident from SpongeBob's hands and reclaims it while healing himself.]
King Neptune: You have been one naughty trident!
Neptune's Trident: [whimpers]
King Neptune: Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
[The trident affectionately licks King Neptune.]
King Neptune: Now let's see if we can fix all of this.
[King Neptune uses the trident's power to stop the geyser and reverse the damage SpongeBob did with it.]
Mr. Krabs: [holding a bat and threatening two fish holding his money]Give me back me money!
[Shubie carries her baby with its regular pacifer. Harold mows the lawn.]
Grass: Mow us good! [gets mowed]
King Neptune: You know, SpongeBob, your spatula is just as powerful as my trident.
SpongeBob: Really?
King Neptune: Ha! Not even close! [laughs] But it's still pretty great.
SpongeBob: Thanks for bailing me out, Neptune. If there's any way I can ever help you, just let me know.
King Neptune: Well, there is one way.
[The scene changes to King Neptune and SpongeBob confronting the two Kraken.]
King Neptune: There they are!
[The two Krakens growl then they gasp.]
SpongeBob: Let's get 'em!
[SpongeBob and King Neptune chase the two Kraken with the monstrous Krabby Patty.]
Plankton: Spot? Spot? [looks under a can] Spot? Where are you, Spot? [whistles] Oh, there you are, boy! Come to me. Jump in my arms and give me your precious kisses.
[Spot crawls over to Plankton, who appears to have grown fatter. Spot rolls himself over and flops on top of Plankton. Plankton pulls himself off of Spot.]
Plankton: Good amoeba. You get a num-num.
[Spot eats the treat and swallows it.]
Karen: Plankton, have you been feeding Spot a lot of treats lately? [measures Spot with the measuring tape] He's looking bigger than usual.
Plankton: Karen! Not in front of the amoeba. Spot is fit as a fiddle.
[Spot burps in Plankton's face.]
Karen: All right, Doctor. If you say so.
Plankton: Come on, I'll prove it.
[The scene changes to Plankton hooking Spot to the analyzer.]
Plankton: Now you'll see how healthy my little Spotty-wotty is.
[Plankton pulls down an x-ray and sees multiple baby amoeba puppies barking. The x-ray then reads, "100% for sure pregnant."]
Plankton: Wha—pregnant? Ah, that can't be right. I thought he was a boy.
Karen: I'm not sure it matters for amoebas. Food-rich environments cause amoebas to reproduce, and you've clearly provided a food-rich environment. [pets Spot as he whines] Who's gonna be a mama? Good boy!
Plankton: We're not ready to have puppies, Karen! This is all happening a little too fast. [grabs a spray bottle and sprays everywhere] We have to set up a state-of-the-art delivery room, sanitize everything, baby-proof the Chum Bucket—wait. Where's Spot?
[Spot is in the closet, whining in the inside. Moments later, green slime comes spewing out from under the door.]
Plankton: What the...
[Plankton scoops up some slime and sees tiny little amoeba puppies.]
Plankton: Puppies?
[Karen opens the closet door and Spot comes out in his normal size.]
Plankton: You did it, boy! Oh, I'm so glad you're okay. [Spot licks him] Wait. Is that my good dinner jacket? [Spot barks]
Karen: [scoops up some of Spot's puppies and some slime] Oh, who cares about a dinner jacket? [rubs the slime and Spot's puppies all over her screen] Aw, look at the little puppies!
Plankton: Yeesh. Calm down, Karen. You don't want to blow out your motherboard.
Karen: Oh, I'm gonna name you Steven and Karen and Clayton and Vincent and—cute overload.
[Karen's computer head spins rapidly, short circuits and blows out. Then her screen goes into rebooting.]
Plankton: Oh, sure, you take a couple of hours to reboot, Karen. It's fine. I'll just manage all these puppies all on my own!
[The puppies bark and lick at each other. They form into a huge blob of slime and eat a stool. Then they jump on the monitor and eat it.]
Plankton: Hey! Get down from there! Stop that! My furniture!
[The puppies eat the beakers and the chemicals vaporize the table.]
Plankton: My experiments! Bad amoebas! Bad! [Spot barks] I don't get it, Karen. Spot is so well behaved, but the puppies don't listen to me at all. I think we need to get rid of them.
[Karen continues to reboot herself.]
Plankton: Yeah, I know what you would say. [imitates Karen] "Don't you vaporize those puppies, Plankton."
[Karen continues to reboot herself.]
Plankton: Fine! If you insist, I'll find a non-vaporizing way to get rid of them. Jeez!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob skipping down the road, creating bubble shapes with his bubble wand along the way.]
SpongeBob: ♪La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la—♪ [stops] Huh? [his bubble wand makes a question mark bubble and sees Plankton making a sign] "Free amoeba puppies?" Oh, hey, Plankton. What's with the sign?
Plankton: I fed Spot too much, and he had puppies. You want a few thousand? [jumps down] They're free with an order of chum.
SpongeBob: [gags] No thank you, Plankton. I, uh, already ate. But I can help you get your puppies adopted. I did get Patrick into a good home.
[Patrick is seen with Mr. Krabs on a leash and acts like a dog as he sniffs a fire hydrant.]
Mr. Krabs: You sure this is a guard dog, SpongeBob?
[Patrick lifts his leg up as if he is about to pee. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Plankton going to the Barg'N-Mart where two girl scout kids are selling cookies.]
Girl Scout: Would you like to purchase—
Plankton: [lifts the table away] This is our corner now!
[The girls cry and run away.]
SpongeBob: Now, Plankton, just politely offer people free puppies, and they'll all be adopted in no time.
Plankton: [to Thaddeus] You there! I demand you take an amoeba puppy!
[Plankton grabs one of the puppies. The amoeba puppy appears to be very small.]
Thaddeus: But that doesn't look like a puppy to me. More like a speck of dirt.
Plankton: These are purebred amoebas, swine! [pulls out a ray gun and shots rapidly at Thaddeus as he runs; a lady walks out of the store] Take this puppy or I'll destroy you!
[The lady screams and runs away.]
SpongeBob: [holds out his eye] Maybe if people could see how cute these puppies are, [puts his eye back in his head] they'd be more interested in taking 'em.
[SpongeBob grabs some of the slime and begins to mold it.]
Plankton: Wait, what are you doing?
[SpongeBob molds the slime into different shapes like an accordion and a ball. Then the slime becomes the amoeba puppy that's just the right size.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
Plankton: I can't believe that actually worked.
Dave: Say, that's a fine-looking amoeba.
SpongeBob: Thanks! You want him? He's free to a good home.
Dave: [the puppy leaps into his arms] Whoo! [gets licked by the puppy and runs off]
Mrs. Puff: Do you have another amoeba? They are too adorable.
Plankton: Smoosh up some more puppies, SpongeBob. We are in business!
SpongeBob: I'm smooshin'! I'm smooshin'!
[SpongeBob takes the box full of amoebas and slime and dumps them onto his body. Then he absorbs them and smooshes them up for a bit. Then he spouts out some more amoeba puppies and gives them to the customers. The amoeba puppies bark.]
Customers: Aww.
[The scene changes to Mrs. Puff's house.]
Mrs. Puff: Don't be sad, Matilda. Mommy has to go to her arraignment, but she'll be back soon. [blows kisses her puppy and leaves]
[The puppy scratches the door as it whines. Suddenly, the puppy rips some wallpaper off the wall and knocks over some stuff. It jumps onto some shelves and breaks some of Mrs. Puff's valuable items, as well as ripping a hole in the wall. Then it opens a jewelry box, swallows a necklace and jumps out the window. Meanwhile at the Chum Bucket, an amoeba puppy runs up to the front door and happily jumps up and down as it barks.]
Plankton: Puppy? You came back?
[The puppy jumps into Plankton's arms and licks him.]
Plankton: [notices the necklace] Did you take this from your new owner? That is rude, puppy! Very, very rude! [notices all the puppies with stuff they stole in their bodies] Wait, you all took something...and brought it back to me? Hmm... [grins evilly as he got an idea] I don't need any of this junk.
[Plankton pulls out the necklace from the puppy's body. He claps his hands and the puppies spit out various stuff.]
Plankton: But perhaps there is something you can do for me, [throws away the stuff] like the Krabby Patty secret formula? [cackles and coughs] Anyone happen to steal a throat lozenge? No? Okay. Come on, pups! We've got some training to do— [stops and sees a motionless Karen still rebooting herself with the stuff piled on her] Still rebooting, huh?
[The puppies run up and chew up all of the stuff they stole off of Karen.]
Plankton: I might need someone to help train these amoebas.
[The puppies are chewing up all over the place. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Plankton.]
SpongeBob: I'm glad you called me, Plankton. I am the best pet trainer in all of Bikini Bottom. [pulls up his pants] Why, Patrick is already housebroken.
[At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is cleaning up the mess Patrick made on the rug.]
Mr. Krabs: [grumbling] Oh, yeah, he'll just use the litter box. [sprays Patrick in the face] Bad Patrick. [Patrick whimpers] Bad Patrick Star.
SpongeBob: To train a puppy, one must think like a puppy. [morphs into an amoeba puppy and barks]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, who is still morphed into an amoeba puppy, providing a class session for the amoeba puppies.]
SpongeBob: Woof, woof, woof! [sits down]
[The puppies sit down like SpongeBob did. The scene changes to Plankton unlocking a door.]
Plankton: Voilà! Eh?
[The puppy liquefies itself and flies through the keyhole. Then it opens the door behind it. The scene changes back to SpongeBob with the other puppies.]
SpongeBob: Woof!
[The puppies stack up together and SpongeBob goes on top.]
SpongeBob: Woof, woof, woof!
[The scene changes to Plankton activating a hand bomb and throws it for the puppy to catch. The puppy comes back and places it down. Plankton screams as he drops the other hand bomb. The two hand bombs collide and explode, leaving Plankton charred. The scene changes back to SpongeBob and Plankton.]
Plankton: Well, SpongeBob, after several grueling hours of training, the puppies are ready. Allow me to introduce them. [pushes button and reveals a puppy with hand bombs strapped in itself] There's Demolitions Puppy.
[The puppy activated the hand bomb, swallows it, and it explodes inside its body.]
Plankton: Acrobat Puppy.
[The puppy with a yellow shirt and red stars flips over with spiky steel cleats.]
Plankton: Identical Twin Puppies.
[The two puppies, with pink shirts, multiply into two.]
Plankton: And of course, Comic Relief Puppy.
[The puppy, with a clown suit, sprays itself with the flower.]
SpongeBob: [becoming suspicious] Hey, is this another plan to steal the secret formula?
Plankton: Of course it is, and there's nothing you can do about it! [laughs and pushes the button]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets lifted] Whoa! [screams as he is thrown in a cage] You'll never get away with this, Plankton!
Plankton: Oh, but I will get away with this, Plankton! I mean, SpongeBob. Allow me to explain.
[As he explains, the puppies make their way to the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: First, we'll need a distraction inside the Krusty Krab. That's where the Identical Twin Puppies come into play.
[One of the Identical Twin Puppies jumps onto the table and barks happily.]
Frankie Billy: Aww, I want one. It's so—
[The customers murmur in awe. Then the other Identical Twin Puppy barks at the other table. The customers look at the puppy in affection. The other puppy jumps at another table and the customers follow it, back and forth. Mr. Krabs and Squidward shrug their shoulders as they have no clue what is going on.]
Plankton: Free from Krabs' watchful eye, Acrobat Puppy can begin his infiltration.
[The Acrobat Puppy liquefies itself into the air vent and makes its way into Mr. Krabs' office. While Patrick is sleeping, the Acrobat Puppy sneaks by quietly and gets to the window.]
Plankton: Once Acrobat Puppy gets inside Krabs' office, he'll open the window for Demolitions Puppy.
[The Acrobat Puppy opens the window and the Demolitions Puppy jumps in and hops onto the safe.]
Plankton: Then, Demolitions Puppy will blow the safe wide open.
[The Demolitions Puppy draws a circle around the safe and puts a bomb on it. The Acrobat Puppy pushes the button and the bomb explodes, opening the safe. Then, the Demolitions Puppy grabs the formula and hops off the safe.]
Plankton: With the safe open, the formula is mine! And finally, just for fun, Comic Relief Puppy adds a dollop of humor.
[The Comic Relief Puppy sprays water in SpongeBob's eyes and pies itself with a pie.]
SpongeBob: That's never gonna work.
Plankton: [laughs] But it already has! [notices the puppies with the formula] What do you think the puppies have been doing all this time? Now to open my prize! [struggles to open the bottle]
[Things start to look bleak for SpongeBob as if Plankton has finally won. However, when he notices Karen rebooting herself, he gets a idea. He takes out his right eye, throws it and knocks over Karen.]
Plankton: Karen! Baby! [runs over to her and tries to lift her up]
[SpongeBob whistles and the puppies remove their clothes.]
SpongeBob: [morphs into an amoeba puppy] Woof, woof, ruff, ruff, woof, woof!
[The puppies stack themselves up and push the lever up. The cage opens.]
SpongeBob: [hops out and changes back] Woof, woof!
[SpongeBob runs over to Plankton as he gets Karen back up.]
SpongeBob: Plankton! Won't you ever learn? You're never gonna get the formula!
Plankton: Come on, SpongeBob. Maybe we can work something out! I'll give ya 10% of my patty profits. Huh?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Plankton. You leave me no choice. [dumps amoeba treats on top of Plankton]
Plankton: [grunts] Uh-oh.
[The puppies run over and start eating all of the treats. As they eat, they grow larger and start to expand. The Chum Bucket explodes as the puppies' growth overloads the restaurant. The puppies fly back down and drops the formula. The bottle rolls back to the Krusty Krab, where Patrick and Mr. Krabs are standing outside. Patrick finds the formula and picks it up.]
Patrick: I believe this is yours.
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Good boy, Patrick! You get a treat!
[Mr. Krabs feeds Patrick a bone and gets licked by him.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay. No, wait! I—Get offa me! What are you—
[The Chum Bucket is completely destroyed and Karen finishes rebooting herself.]
Karen: Reboot...complete. Oh! Oh! Oh ha! More puppies? For me?! Oh, Sheldon, I couldn't be happier! [laughing]
[Karen grabs some of the slime with the amoeba puppies and smooshes it into a really large puppy.]
Plankton: Wait, puppy. Whoa, puppy! [gets crushed by the large puppy] Ooh! Cute...overload! Aah!
